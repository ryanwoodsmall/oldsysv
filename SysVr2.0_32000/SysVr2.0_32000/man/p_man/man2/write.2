.TH WRITE 2 
.SH NAME
write \- write on a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int write (fildes, buf, nbyte)
.br
.B int fildes;
.br
.B char \(**buf;
.br
.B unsigned nbyte;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fildes\^
is a
file descriptor
obtained from a
.IR creat ,
.IR open ,
.IR dup ,
.IR fcntl ,
or
.I pipe\^
system call.
.PP
.I Write\^
attempts to write
.I nbyte\^
bytes from the buffer pointed to by
.I buf\^
to the file associated with the
.IR fildes .
.PP
On devices capable of seeking,
the actual writing of data proceeds from the position in the file
indicated by the file pointer.
Upon return from 
.IR write ,
the file pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually written.
.PP
On devices incapable of seeking,
writing always takes place starting at the current position.
The value of a file pointer associated with such a device is
undefined.
.PP
If the
.SM O_APPEND
flag of the file status flags is set,
the file pointer will be set to the end of the file prior to each write.
.PP
.I Write\^
will fail and the file pointer will remain unchanged if one or more of the
following are true:
.TP 15
.SM
\%[EBADF]
.I Fildes\^
is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.
.TP
.SM
\%[EPIPE and SIGPIPE signal]
An attempt is made to write to a pipe that is not open
for reading by any process.
.TP
.SM
\%[EFBIG]
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
process's file size limit or the maximum file size.
See 
.IR ulimit (2).
.TP
.SM
\%[EFAULT]
.I Buf\^
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.TP
.SM
\%[EINTR]
A signal was caught during the
.I write\^
system call.
.PP
If a
.I write\^
requests that more bytes be written than there is room for
{e.g., the
.I ulimit\^
[see
.IR ulimit (2)]
or the physical end of a medium},
only as many bytes as there is room for will be written.
For example,
suppose there is space for 20 bytes more in a file before
reaching a limit.
A write of 512  bytes will return 20.
The next write of a non-zero number of bytes will give a failure return
(except as noted below).
.PP
.PP
If the file being written is a pipe (or
.SM FIFO\*S)
and the
.SM O_NDELAY
flag of the file flag word is set,
then write to a full pipe (or
.SM FIFO\*S)
will return a count of 0.
Otherwise (\c
.SM O_NDELAY
clear), writes to a full pipe (or
.SM FIFO\*S)
will block until space becomes available.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion the number of bytes actually written
is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.I errno\^
is set to indicate the error.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
creat(2), dup(2), lseek(2), open(2), pipe(2), ulimit(2).
