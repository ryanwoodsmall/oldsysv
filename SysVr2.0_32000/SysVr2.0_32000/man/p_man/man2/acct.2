.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int acct (path)
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Acct\^
is used to enable or disable the system process accounting routine.
If the routine is enabled, an accounting record will be written on an
accounting file for each process that terminates.
Termination can be caused by one of two things: an
.I exit\^
call or a signal; see
.IR exit "(2) and " signal (2).
The effective user
.SM ID
of the calling process must be super-user to use this call.
.PP
.I Path\^
points to a path name naming the accounting file.
The accounting file format is given in
.IR acct (4).

The accounting routine is enabled if
.I path\^
is non-zero and no errors occur during the system call.
It is disabled if
.I path\^
is zero and no errors occur during the system call.
