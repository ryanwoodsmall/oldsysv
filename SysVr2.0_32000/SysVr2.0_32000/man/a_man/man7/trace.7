.TH TRACE 7
.SH NAME
trace \- event-tracing driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Trace\^
is a special
file that allows event records generated within the
.SM UNIX
system kernel to be passed
to a user program so that the
activity of a driver or other system routines can be monitored for
debugging purposes.
.PP
An event record is generated from within a kernel driver or system routine by
invoking the
.I trsave
function:
.PP
.RS
trsave (dev, chno, buf, cnt)
.br
char	dev, chno, \(**buf, cnt;
.RE
.PP
.I Dev\^
is a minor device number of the trace driver;
.I chno\^
is an integer between 0 and 15 inclusive that identifies
the data stream (channel) to which the record belongs;
.I buf\^
is a buffer containing the data
for an event; and
.I cnt\^
is the number
of bytes in
.IR buf .
Calls to
.I trsave\^
will result in data being placed on a queue,
provided that some user program has opened the trace minor device
.I dev\^
and has enabled channel
.IR chno .
Event records consisting of a time stamp (4 bytes),
the channel number (1 byte), the count (1 byte),
and the event data
.RI ( cnt
bytes) are stored on a
queue until
a system-defined maximum (\c
.SM TRQMAX\*S)
is reached;
an event record is discarded if there is not sufficient room
on the queue for the entire record.
The
queue is emptied by a user program reading the
trace driver.
Each
.IR read
returns an integral number of event
records; the read count must, therefore, be at
least equal to
.I cnt
plus six.
.PP
The
.I trace\^
driver supports
.IR open,
.IR close(2),
.IR ioctl(2),
and
.IR read(2),
system calls.
The
.I ioctl
system call is invoked as follows:
.PP
.RS
#include \|<sys/vpm\f3.\fPh>
.br
int fildes, cmd,  arg;
.br
ioctl (fildes, cmd, arg);
.RE
.PP
The values for the
.I cmd
argument are:
.HP 7
\s-1VPMSETC\s+1\-Enable trace channels.
This command enables each channel indicated
by a 1 in the bit mask found in
.IR arg .
The low-order bit (bit 0) corresponds to channel zero,
the next bit (bit 1) corresponds to channel 1, etc.
.HP 7
\s-1VPMGETC\s+1\-Get enabled channels.
This command returns in
.I arg
a bit mask containing a 1 for each channel that is currently enabled.
.HP 7
\s-1VPMCLRC\s+1\-Disable channels.
This command disables the channels indicated
by a 1 in the bit mask found in
.IR arg .
