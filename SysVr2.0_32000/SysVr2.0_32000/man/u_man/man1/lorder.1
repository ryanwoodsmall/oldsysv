.TH LORDER 1
.SH NAME
lorder \- find ordering relation for an object library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lorder
file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The input
is one or more object or library archive
.I files\^
[see
.IR ar (1)].
The standard output
is a list of pairs of object file names,
meaning that the first file of the pair refers to
external identifiers defined in the second.
The output may be processed by
.IR tsort (1)
to find an ordering of
a library suitable for one-pass access by
.IR ld (1).
Note that the link editor
.IR ld (1)
is capable of multiple passes over an archive in the portable archive format
[see
.IR ar (4)]
and does not require that
.IR lorder (1)
be used when building an archive.  The usage of 
the
.IR lorder (1)
command may, however, allow for a slightly more efficient access of
the archive during the link edit process.
.PP
The following example builds a new library
from existing
.B \&.o
files.

.SH BUGS
Object files whose names do not end with
.BR .o ,
even when
contained in library archives, are overlooked.
Their global symbols and references are attributed to
some other file.
