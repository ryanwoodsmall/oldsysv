.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cflow

files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cflow
analyzes a collection of
.SM C\*S,
.SM YACC\*S,
.SM LEX\*S,
assembler, and object files
and attempts to build a graph charting the external references.
Files suffixed in
.BR .y ,
.BR .l ,
.BR .c ,
and
.BR .i
are
.SM YACC\*S'd,
.SM LEX\*S'd,
and C-preprocessed
(bypassed for
.B .i
files)
as appropriate
and then run through the first pass of
.IR lint (1).
(The
.BR \-I \*S,
.BR \-D \*S,
and
.BR \-U
options of the C-preprocessor are also understood.)
Files suffixed with
.B .s
are assembled and information
is extracted
(as in
.B .o
files)
from the symbol table.
The output of all this non-trivial processing
is collected and turned into a graph of external references
which is displayed upon the standard output.
.PP
Each line of output begins with a reference
(i.e., line)
number, followed by a suitable number of tabs
indicating the level.
Then the name of the global
(normally only a function not defined as an external or
beginning with an underscore; see below for the
.B \-i
inclusion option)
a colon
and its definition.
For information extracted from C source,
the definition consists of an abstract type declaration
(e.g.,
.BR "char \(**" ),
and, delimited by angle brackets,
the name of the source file
and the line number
where the definition was found.
Definitions extracted from object files
indicate the file name and location
counter under which the symbol appeared
(e.g.,
.IR text ).
Leading underscores in C-style external names are deleted.
.PP
Once a definition of a name has been printed,
subsequent references to that name contain
only the reference number of the line
where the definition may be found.
For undefined references, only
.B <\|>
is printed.
.PP
As an example, given the following in
.IR file.c :
.sp
.nf
.na
	int	i;

	main()
	{
		f();
		g();
		f();
	}

	f()
	{
		i = h();
	}
.ad
.fi
.sp
the command
.sp
.nf
.na
	cflow \-ix file.c
.fi
.ad
.sp
produces the output
.sp
.nf
.na
	1	main: int(), <file.c 4>
	2		f: int(), <file.c 11>
	3			h: <>
	4			i: int, <file.c 1>
	5		g: <>
.ad
.fi
.sp
When the nesting level becomes too deep, the
.BR \-e
option of
.IR pr (1)
can be used to compress the tab expansion to something
less than every eight spaces.
.PP
The following options are interpreted by
.IR cflow :
.TP \w'\fB\-d\fPnum\ \ 'u
.B \-r
Reverse the ``caller:callee'' relationship producing an inverted listing
showing the callers of each function.
The listing is also sorted in
lexicographical order by callee.
.TP
.B \-ix
Include external and static data symbols. The default is to include
only functions in the flowgraph.
.TP
.B \-i_
Include names that begin with an underscore. The default is to exclude
these functions (and data if \fI\-ix\fP is used).
.TP
.BR \-d num
The
.I num
decimal integer indicates the depth at which the flowgraph
is cut off.
By default this is a very large number.
Attempts to set
the cutoff depth to a nonpositive integer will be met with contempt.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Complains about bad options.
Complains about multiple definitions
and only believes the first.
Other messages may come from the various
programs used (e.g., the C-preprocessor).

.SH BUGS
Files produced by
.IR lex (1)
and
.IR yacc (1)
cause the reordering of line number declarations which can
confuse
.IR cflow .
To get proper results, feed
.I cflow
the
.I yacc
or
.I lex
input.
