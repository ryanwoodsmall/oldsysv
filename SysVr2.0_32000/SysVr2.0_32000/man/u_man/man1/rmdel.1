.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rmdel\^
removes the delta specified by the
.SM \fISID\fP
from each
named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
The delta to be removed must be the newest (most recent) delta
in its branch in the delta chain of each
named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file.
In addition,
the \*(I) specified must
.I not\^
be that of a version being edited for the purpose of
making a delta (i. e.,
if a
.I p-file\^
[see
.IR get (1)]
exists for the named \s-1SCCS\s+1 file,
the \*(I) specified must
.I not\^
appear in any entry of the
.I p-file\c\^
).
.PP
If a directory is named,
.I rmdel\^
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\s-1SCCS\s+1 files
(last component of the path name does not begin with \fBs.\fR)
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of \fB\-\fR is given, the standard input is read;
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an \s-1SCCS\s+1 file
to be processed;
non-\s-1SCCS\s+1 files and unreadable files are silently ignored.
.PP
The exact permissions necessary to remove a delta
are documented in the
.IR "Source Code Control System User Guide" .
Simply stated,
they are either (1)
if you make a delta you can remove it;
or (2)
if you own the file and directory you can remove a delta.
