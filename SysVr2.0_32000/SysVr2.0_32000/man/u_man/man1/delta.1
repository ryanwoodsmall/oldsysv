.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Delta\^
is used to permanently introduce into
the named \*(S) file changes that were made to the file retrieved by
.IR get (1)
(called the
.IR g-file ,
or generated file).
.PP
.I Delta\^
makes a delta to each named \*(S) file.
If a directory is named,
.I delta\^
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-\*(S) files
(last component of the path name does not begin with \fBs.\fR)
and unreadable files
are silently ignored.
If a name of \fB\-\fR is given, the standard input is read
(see \*(W));
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an \*(S) file
to be processed.
.PP
.I Delta\^
may issue prompts on the standard output depending upon
certain keyletters specified and flags
[see
.IR admin (1)]
that may be
present in the \*(S) file
(see
.B \-m
and
.B \-y
keyletters below).
.PP
Keyletter arguments
apply independently
to each named file.
.A2 r SID Uniquely
identifies which delta is to be made to the \*(S) file.
The use of this keyletter is necessary only if two or more
outstanding
.IR get s
for editing
.RB ( "get \-e" )
on the same \*(S) file were done by the same person
(login name).
The \*(I) value specified with the
.B \-r
keyletter can be either the \*(I) specified on the
.I get\^
command line or the \*(I) to be made as reported by the
.I get\^
command
[see
.IR get (1)].
A diagnostic results if the specified \*(I) is ambiguous, or,
if necessary and omitted on the command line.
.AR s Suppresses
the issue, on the standard output, of the created delta's \*(I),
as well as the number of lines inserted, deleted and unchanged in the
\*(S) file.
.AR n Specifies retention of the edited
.I g-file\^
(normally removed at completion of delta processing).
.A2 g list Specifies
a \fIlist\fR (see
.IR get (1)
for the definition of \fIlist\fR)
of deltas which are to be
.I ignored\^
when the file is accessed at the change level (\*(I))
created by this delta.
.A1 m mrlist If
the \*(S) file has the
.B v
flag set
[see
.IR admin (1)]
then a Modification Request (\*(M)) number \fImust\fR be
supplied as the reason for creating the new delta.
.C1 \& If
.B \-m
is not used and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
.SM
.B MR\*Ss?
is issued on the standard output before the standard input
is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt is issued.
The
.SM
.B MR\*Ss?
prompt always precedes the
.B comments?
prompt
(see
.B \-y
keyletter).
.PP
.C1 \& \*(M)s
in a list are separated by blanks and/or tab characters.
An unescaped new-line character terminates the \*(M) list.
.C1 \& Note
that if the
.B v
flag has a value
[see
.IR admin (1)],
it is taken to be the name of a program (or shell procedure) which will validate
the correctness of the \*(M) numbers.
If a non-zero exit status is returned from \*(M) number validation program,
.I delta\^
terminates
(it is assumed that the \*(M) numbers were not all valid).
.A1 y comment Arbitrary
text
used to describe the reason for making the delta.
A null string is considered a valid \fIcomment\fR.
.C1 \& If
.B \-y
is not specified and the standard input is a terminal, the prompt
.B comments?
is issued on the standard output before the standard
input is read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no
prompt is issued.
An unescaped new-line character terminates the comment text.
.AR p Causes
.I delta\^
to print (on the standard output) the \*(S) file
differences before and after the delta is applied
in a
.IR diff (1)
format.

.SH FILES
All files of the form
.IR ?- file
are explained in the
\fISource Code Control System User Guide\fP.
The naming convention for these files is also described there.

.SH WARNINGS
Lines beginning with an \s-1\fBSOH\fP ASCII\s+1 character (binary 001)
cannot be placed in the \*(S) file unless the
.SM
.B SOH
is escaped.
This character has special meaning to \*(S)
[see
\f2sccsfile\fR(4)
(5)] and will cause an error.
.PP
A
.I get\^
of many \*(S) files,
followed by a
.I delta\^
of those files, should be avoided when the
.I get\^
generates a large amount of data.
Instead,
multiple
.I "get/delta\^"
sequences should be used.
.PP
If the standard input
(\fB\-\fR)
is specified on the
.I delta\^
command line,
the
.B \-m
(if necessary)
and
.B \-y
keyletters
.I must\^
also be present.
Omission of these keyletters causes an error to occur.
.PP
Comments are limited to text strings of at most 512 characters.
