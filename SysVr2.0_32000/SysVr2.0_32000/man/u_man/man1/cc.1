.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cc
[ option ] ... file ...

.B pcc
[ option ] ... file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cc\^
is the \s-1UNIX\s+1 system C compiler.
.PP
Arguments whose names end with \f3.c\fP are taken to
be C source programs.
They are compiled, and
each object program is left on the file
whose name is that of the source with \f3.o\fP substituted
for \f3.c\fP.
The \f3.o\fP file is normally deleted, however, if a
single C program is compiled and loaded all at one go.
.PP
In the same way,
arguments whose names end with \f3.s\fP are taken to be assembly source programs
and are assembled, producing a \f3.o\fP file.
.PP
The following options are interpreted by
.I cc\^
and
.IR pcc .
See
.IR ld (1)
for link editor options and
.IR cpp (1)
for more preprocessor options.
.TP 8
.B \-c
Suppress the link edit phase of the compilation and force
an object file to be produced even if only one program is compiled.
.TP
.B \-p
Arrange for the compiler to produce code
that counts the number of times each routine is called;
also, if link editing takes place, replace the standard startoff
routine by one that automatically calls
.IR monitor (3C)
at the start and arranges to write out a
.B mon.out
file at normal termination of execution of the object program.
An execution profile can then be generated by
use of
.IR prof (1).
.TP
.B \-f
Link the object program with the floating-point interpreter
for systems without hardware floating-point.
.TP
.B \-g
Cause the compiler
to generate additional information
needed for the use of
.IR sdb (1).
.TP
.B \-O
Invoke an
object-code optimizer.
.TP
.B \-S
Compile the named C programs and leave the
assembler-language output on corresponding files suffixed \f3.s\fP.
.TP
.B \-E
Run only
.IR cpp (1)
on the named C programs and send the result to the
standard output.
.TP
.B \-P
Run only
.IR cpp (1)
on the named C programs and leave the result
on corresponding files suffixed \f3.i\fP.
.TP
.BI \-B string\^
Construct pathnames for substitute preprocessor, compiler,
assembler and link editor passes by concatenating
.I string\^
with the suffixes
.BR cpp ,
.B c0
(or
.B ccom
or
.BR comp ,
see under \s-1FILES\s+1 below),
.BR c1 ,
.B c2
(or
.BR optim ),
.B as
and
.BR ld .
If
.I string\^
is empty it is taken to be
.BR /lib/o .
.TP
.BR \-t [ p012al ]
Find only the designated preprocessor, compiler, assembler and
link editor passes in the files whose names are constructed by a
.B \-B
option.
In the absence of a
.B \-B
option, the
.I string\^
is taken to be
.BR /lib/n .
The value
.B \-t
""
is equivalent to
.BR \-tp012 .
.TP
.BI \-W c,arg1[,arg2...]
Hand off the argument[s]
.I argi
to pass
.I c
where
.I c
is one of
.RB [ p012al ]
indicating preprocessor,
compiler first pass,
compiler second pass,
optimizer,
assembler,
or link editor, respectively.
.PP
Other arguments
are taken
to be either link editor option arguments,
C preprocessor option arguments,
or C-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier
.I cc\^
or
.I pcc\^
run,
or perhaps libraries of C-compatible routines.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are linked (in the order
given) to produce an executable program with the name
.BR a.out .
.PP
The
.SM C
language standard was extended to include arbitrary length variable names.
The option pair
.RB `` \-Wp,\-T
.BR \-W0,\-XT ''
will cause the current compiler to behave the same as previous compilers
with respect to the length of variable names.

.SH NOTES
.PP
By default, the return value from a
.SM C
program is completely random.
The only two guaranteed ways to return a specific value are to explicitly
call
.IR exit (2)
or to leave the function
.BR main\^ ( )
with a
.RB `` return
.IR expression ;''
construct.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by C itself are intended to be
self-explanatory.
Occasional messages may be produced by the assembler or the link editor.
