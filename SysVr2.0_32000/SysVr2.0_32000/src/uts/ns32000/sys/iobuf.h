/*
 * Each block device has a iobuf, which contains private state stuff
 * and 2 list heads: the b_forw/b_back list, which is doubly linked
 * and has all the buffers currently associated with that major
 * device; and the d_actf/d_actl list, which is private to the
 * device but in fact is always used for the head and tail
 * of the I/O queue for the device.
 * Various routines in bio.c look at b_forw/b_back
 * (notice they are the same as in the buf structure)
 * but the rest is private to each device driver.
