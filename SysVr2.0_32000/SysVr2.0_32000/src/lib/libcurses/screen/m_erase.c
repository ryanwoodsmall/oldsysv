 *	mini.c contains versions of curses routines for minicurses.
 *	They work just like their non-mini counterparts but draw on
 *	std_body rather than stdscr.  This cuts down on overhead but
 *	restricts what you are allowed to do - you can't get stuff back
 *	from the screen and you can't use multiple windows or things
 *	like insert/delete line (the logical ones that affect the screen).
 *	All this but multiple windows could probably be added if somebody
 *	wanted to mess with it.
