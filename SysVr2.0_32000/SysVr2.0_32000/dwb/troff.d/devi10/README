This directory contains source for the troff postprocessor
for the Imagen Imprint-10 laser printer.  It also contains
the source for the font tables and DESC file for that device.

di10:
	interprets output of device-independent troff, converts
	it into canon format.  Not smart about typesetters
	for which the character set doesn't match the troff
	character set well.  Creates an output file in /tmp/dcana* and
	calls ipr to put its output in spool directory.
	ipr and its subsidiary programs are supplied by Imagen.

makei10:
	Reads the binary '.out' files for the 202 or i10, and the ASCII
	font and device files for the APS, and writes a new
	set of ASCII files for the APS into a directory called
	devaps in the directory with the raster files.  Makei10
	expects to find the ASCII font files for the APS in
	directory devaps below the parent of the working directory.
	Only "di10" will read the new set of font tables for the APS.
	Troff will still use the files in the original devaps directory.
	Once you've run 'makei10' you'll still have to run
	makedev before 'di10' will be happy.
	Was written with tabs set to every fourth column, so
	things will look a little funny unless your tabs are
	set the same way.

	N.B.  It is not necessary to run this program if you are
	content with the distributed set of font files in 
	devi10/rasti10/devaps.
