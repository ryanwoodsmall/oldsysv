.TH ERRDEMON 1M
.SH NAME
errdemon \- error-logging daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR /usr/lib/errdemon " [ file ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The error logging daemon
.I errdemon\^
collects error records from the operating system
by reading the special file
.B /dev/error
and places them in
.IR file .
If
.I file\^
is not specified when the daemon is activated,
.B /usr/adm/errfile
is used.
Note that
.I file\^
is created if it does not exist;
otherwise, error records are appended to it,
so that no previous error data is lost.
No analysis of the error records is done by
.IR errdemon ;
that responsibility is left to
.IR errpt (1M).
The error-logging daemon is terminated by sending
it a software kill signal (see
.IR signal (2)).
Only the super-user may start the daemon, and only one
daemon may be active at any time.
.SH FILES
.ta \w'/usr/adm/errfile   'u
/dev/error	source of error records
.br
/usr/adm/errfile	repository for error records
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by 
.I errdemon\^
are intended to be self-explanatory.
