.TH ERRDEAD 1M
.SH NAME
errdead \- extract error records from dump
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR /etc/errdead " dumpfile [ namelist ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
When hardware errors are detected by the system,
an error record that contains information pertinent
to the error is generated.
If the error-logging daemon
.IR errdemon (1M)
is not active or if the system
crashes before the record can be placed in the
error file,
the error information is held by the system in a local buffer.
.I Errdead\^
examines a system dump (or memory),
extracts such error records,
and passes them to
.IR errpt (1M)
for analysis.
.PP
The
.I dumpfile\^
specifies the file (or memory) that
is to be examined.
The system namelist is specified by
.IR namelist ;
if not given,
.B /unix
is used.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnostics may come from either

or

In either case, they
are intended to be self-explanatory.
