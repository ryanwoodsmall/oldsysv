.TH MEM 7
.SH NAME
mem, kmem \- core memory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mem\^
is a special file that is an image of the core memory
of the computer.
It may be used, for example, to examine,
and even to patch the system.
.PP
Byte addresses in
.I mem\^
are interpreted as memory addresses.
References to non-existent locations cause errors to be returned.
.PP
Examining and patching device registers is likely
to lead to unexpected results when read-only or write-only
bits are present.
.PP
The file
.I kmem\^
is the same as 
.I mem\^
except that kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
.PP
On the
.SM PDP\*S-11,
the I/O page
begins at location 0160000 of
.I kmem\^
and per-process data for the current process
begins at 0140000.
.SH FILES
/dev/mem,
/dev/kmem
.SH BUGS
On the
.SM PDP\*S-11,
memory files are accessed one byte
at a time, an inappropriate method for some
device registers.
