.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Exec\^
in all its forms transforms the calling process into a new process.
The new process is constructed from an ordinary, executable file called the
.IR "new process file" .
This file consists of a header (see
.IR a.out (4)),
a text segment, and a data segment.
The data segment contains an initialized portion and an uninitialized
portion (bss).
There can be no return from a successful 
.I exec\^
because the calling process is overlaid by the new process.
.PP
When a C program is executed, it is called as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
.B "main (argc, argv, envp)"
.B "int argc;"
.B "char \(**\(**argv, \(**\(**envp;
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I argc
is the argument count and
.I argv
is an array of character pointers to the arguments themselves.
As indicated,
.I argc
is conventionally at least one and the first member of the array
points to a string containing the name of the file.
.PP
.I Path\^
points to a path name that identifies the new process file.
.PP
.I File\^
points to the new process file.
The path prefix for this file is obtained by a search of the directories
passed as the
.I environment\^
line "\s-1PATH\s+1 ="
(see
.IR environ (5)).
The environment
is supplied by the shell (see
.IR sh (1)).
.PP
.IR Arg0 ", " arg1 ", " ... ,
.I argn\^
are pointers to null-terminated character strings.
These strings constitute the argument list available to the new process.
By convention, at least
.I arg0\^
must be present and point to a string that is the same as
.I path\^
(or its last component).
.PP
.I Argv\^
is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings.
These strings constitute the argument list available to the new process.
By convention,
.I argv\^
must have at least one member, and it must point to a string that is the same as
.IR path\^
(or its last component).
.I Argv\^
is terminated by a null pointer.
.PP
.I Envp\^
is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings.
These strings constitute the environment
for the new process.
.I Envp\^
is terminated by a null pointer.
For
.I execl\^
and
.IR execv ,
the C run-time start-off routine places a pointer to the calling process's
environment in the global cell:
.br
.B "	extern char \(**\(**environ;"
.br
and it is used to pass the calling process's environment to the new process.
.PP
File descriptors open in the calling process remain open in the new process,
except for those whose
\%close-on-exec 
flag is set; see 
.IR fcntl (2).
For those file descriptors that remain open, the file pointer is unchanged.
.PP
Signals set to terminate the calling process will be set to terminate the
new process.
Signals set to be ignored by the calling process will be set to be
ignored by the new process.
Signals set to be caught by the calling process will be set to terminate
new process; see 
.IR signal (2).
.PP
If the set-user-\s-1ID\s+1
mode bit of the new process file is set
(see 
.IR chmod (2)),
.I exec\^
sets the effective user
.SM ID
of the new process to the owner
.SM ID
of the new process file.
Similarly, if the set-group-\s-1ID\s+1 mode bit of the
new process file is set, the effective group
.SM ID
of the new process
is set to the group
.SM ID
of the new process file.
The real user
.SM ID
and real group 
.SM ID
of the new process remain the same as those of the calling process.
.PP
The shared memory segments attached to the calling process will not be
attached to the new process (see
.IR shmop (2)).
.PP
Profiling is disabled for the new process; see
.IR profil (2).
.PP 
The new process also inherits the following attributes from the calling process:
.PP
.PD 0
.RS 0.5i
.PP
nice value (see 
.IR nice (2))
.PP

.SM ID
.PP
parent process
.SM ID
.PP

.SM ID
.PP
semadj values (see
.IR semop (2))
.PP
tty group
.SM ID
(see 
.IR exit (2)
and
.IR signal (2))
.PP
trace flag (see
.IR ptrace "(2) request 0)"
.PP
time left until an alarm clock signal (see 
.IR alarm (2))
.PP

.PP

.PP

.IR umask (2))
.PP

.IR ulimit (2))
.PP

.IR stime ,
.IR cutime ,
and
.I cstime\^
(see 
.IR times (2))
.RE
.PD
.PP
.I Exec\^
will fail and return to the calling process if one or more of the
following are true:
.IP
One or more components of the new process file's path name do not exist.
.SM
\%[ENOENT]
.IP
A component of the new process file's path prefix is not a directory.
.SM
\%[ENOTDIR]
.IP
Search permission is denied for a directory listed in the new process file's
path prefix.
.SM
\%[EACCES]
.IP
The new process file is not an ordinary file.
.SM
\%[EACCES]
.IP
The new process file mode denies execution permission.
.SM
\%[EACCES]
.IP
The exec is not an
.I execlp\^
or
.IR execvp\^ ,
and the new process file has the appropriate access permission
but an invalid magic number in its header.
.SM
\%[ENOEXEC]
.IP
The new process file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is
currently open for writing by some process.
.SM
\%[ETXTBSY]
.IP
The new process requires more memory than is allowed by the system-imposed
maximum
.SM MAXMEM.
.SM
\%[ENOMEM]
.IP
The number of bytes in the new process's argument list is greater than the
system-imposed limit of 5120 bytes.
.SM
\%[E2BIG]
.IP
The new process file is not as long as indicated by the size values in its
header.
.SM
\%[EFAULT]
.IP
.IR Path ,
.IR argv ,
or
.I envp\^

.SM
\%[EFAULT]
.SH RETURN VALUE
If 
.I exec\^
returns to the calling process an error has occurred; the return value
will be \-1 and 
.I errno\^
will be set to indicate the error.
