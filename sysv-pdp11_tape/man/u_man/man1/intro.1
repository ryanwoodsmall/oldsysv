.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon termination, each command returns two bytes of status,
one supplied by the system and giving the cause for
termination, and (in the case of ``normal'' termination)
one supplied by the program
(see
.IR wait (2)
and
.IR exit (2)).
The former byte is 0 for normal termination; the latter
is customarily 0 for successful execution and non-zero
to indicate troubles such as erroneous parameters, bad or inaccessible data,
or other inability to cope with the task at hand.
It is called variously ``exit code'', ``exit status'', or
``return code'', and is described only where special
conventions are involved.
.SH BUGS
Regretfully, many commands do not adhere to the aforementioned syntax.
