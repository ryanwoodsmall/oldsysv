.TH ASA 1
.SH NAME
asa \- interpret \s-1ASA\s+1 carriage control characters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B asa
\%[\|files\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Asa
interprets the output of
.SM FORTRAN
programs that
utilize \s-1ASA\s+1 carriage control characters.
It processes either
the
.I files
whose names are given as arguments or the standard input if no
file names are supplied.
The first character of each line is assumed to be
a control character; their meanings are:
.PP
.TP 8
.B \(fm\0\(fm
(blank) single new line before printing
.TP
.B 0
double new line before printing
.TP
.B 1
new page before printing
.TP
.B +
overprint previous line.
.PP
Lines beginning with other than the above characters are treated as if
they began with
.BR \(fm\0\(fm .
The first character of a line is
.IR not
printed.
If any such lines appear, an appropriate diagnostic will appear on standard
error.
This program forces the first line of each input file to start on
a new page.
.PP
To correctly view the output of 
.SM FORTRAN
programs which use
.SM ASA
carriage control characters, \fIasa\fP could be used as a filter thusly:
.sp
.DS
	a.out | asa | lpr
.DE
.sp
and the output, properly formatted and pagenated, would be directed to the
line printer.
.SM FORTRAN
output sent to a file could be viewed by:
.sp
.DS
	asa file
.DE
