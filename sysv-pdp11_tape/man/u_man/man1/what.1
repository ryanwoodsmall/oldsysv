.TH WHAT 1
.SH NAME
what \- identify \s-1SCCS\s+1 files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B what
files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I What\^
searches the given files for all occurrences
of the pattern that
.IR get (1)
substitutes for %\&Z% (this is
\fB@\&(#)\fR
at this printing)
and prints out what follows until the
first
.BR ~ ,
.BR > ,
new-line,
.BR \e ,
or null character.
For example, if the C program in file \fBf.c\fR contains
.PP
.RS 5
char ident[] = "\|@\&(#)identification information\|";
.RE
.PP
and \fBf.c\fR is compiled to yield \fBf.o\fR and \fBa.out\fR,
then the command
.PP
.RS 5
what\|
.RB f . c\|
.RB f . o\|
.RB a . out
.RE
.PP
will print
.PP
.RS 5
.TP 8
f\fB.\fRc:
.br
identification information
.TP 8
f\fB.\fRo:
.br
identification information
.TP 8
a\fB.\fRout:
.br
identification information
.RE
.PP
.I What\^
is intended to be used in conjunction with the \*(S) command
.IR get (1),
which automatically inserts identifying information,
but it can also be used where the information is inserted manually.
.SH SEE ALSO
get(1), help(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Use
.IR help (1)
for explanations.
.SH BUGS
It's possible that an unintended occurrence of the pattern
.B @\&(#)
could be
found just by chance, but this causes no harm in nearly all cases.
