.TH XARGS 1
.SH NAME
xargs \- construct argument list(s) and execute command 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xargs
[\|flags\|] [ command [\|initial-arguments\|] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xargs\^
combines the fixed
.I initial-arguments\^
with arguments read from standard input to execute the specified
.I command\^
one or more times.
The number of arguments read for each
.I command\^
invocation
and the manner in which they are combined
are determined by the flags specified.
.PP
.IR Command ,
which may be a shell file,
is searched for, using one's \fB\s-1$PATH\s+1\fP.
If
.I command\^
is omitted,
.B /bin/echo
is used.
.PP
Arguments read in from standard input are defined to be contiguous
strings of characters delimited by one or more blanks, tabs, or new-lines;
empty lines are always discarded.
Blanks and tabs may be embedded as part of an argument if escaped or quoted:
Characters enclosed in quotes (single or double) are taken literally,
and the delimiting quotes are removed.
Outside of quoted strings a backslash
.RB "(" \e ")"
will escape the next character.
.PP
Each argument list is constructed starting with the
.IR initial-arguments ,
followed by some number of
arguments read from standard input
(Exception: see
.B \-i
flag).
Flags
.BR \-i ,
.BR \-l ,
and
.BR \-n
determine how arguments are selected for each command invocation.
When none of these flags are coded,
the
.I initial-arguments\^
are followed by arguments read continuously from standard input until an internal buffer is full,
and then
.I command\^
is executed with the accumulated args.
This process is repeated
until there are no more args.
When there are flag conflicts (e.g.,
.B \-l
vs.
.BR \-n "),"
the last flag has precedence.
.I Flag\^
values are:
.TP 20
.BI \-l number\^
.I Command\^
is executed for each non-empty
.I number\^
lines of arguments from standard input.
The last invocation of
.I command\^
will be with fewer lines of arguments if fewer than
.I number\^
remain.
A line is considered to end with the first new-line
.I unless\^
the last character of the line is a blank or a tab;
a trailing blank/tab signals continuation through the next non-empty line.
If
.I number\^
is omitted 1 is assumed.
Option
.B \-x
is forced.
.TP 20
.BI \-i replstr\^
Insert mode:
.I command\^
is executed for each line from standard input,
taking the entire line as a single arg, inserting it in
.I initial-arguments\^
for each occurrence of
.IR replstr .
A maximum of 5 arguments in
.I initial-arguments\^
may each contain one or more instances of
.IR replstr .
Blanks and tabs at the beginning of each line are thrown away.
Constructed arguments may not grow larger than 255 characters, and option
.B \-x
is also forced.
.B "{\|}"
is assumed for
.I replstr\^
if not specified.
.TP 20
.BI \-n number\^
Execute
.I command\^
using as many standard input arguments as possible, up to
.I number\^
arguments maximum.
Fewer arguments will be used if their total size is greater than
.I size\^
characters, and for the last invocation if there are fewer than
.I number\^
arguments remaining.
If option
.B \-x
is also coded, each
.I number\^
arguments must fit in the
.I size\^
limitation, else
.I xargs\^
terminates execution.
.TP 20
.B \-t
Trace mode: The
.I command\^
and each constructed argument list are echoed to file descriptor 2
just prior to their execution.
.TP 20
.B \-p
Prompt mode: The user is asked whether to execute
.I command\^
each invocation. Trace mode (\c
.B \-t\c
) is turned on to print the command instance to be executed,
followed by a \fB?.\|.\|.\fP prompt.
A reply of
.B y
(optionally followed by anything) will execute the command; anything else, including
just a carriage return, skips that particular invocation of
.IR command .
.TP 20
.B \-x
Causes
.I xargs\^
to terminate if any argument list would be greater than
.I size\^
characters;
.B \-x
is forced by the options
.B \-i
and
.BR \-l .
When neither of the options
.BR \-i ,
.BR \-l ,
or
.B \-n
are coded, the total length of all arguments must be within the
.I size\^
limit.
.TP 20
.BI \-s size\^
The maximum total size of each argument list is set to
.I size\^
characters;
.I size\^
must be a positive integer less than or equal to 470. If
.B \-s
is not coded, 470 is taken as the default.
Note that the character count for
.I size\^
includes one extra character for each argument and the count of characters in the command name.
.TP 20
.BI \-e eofstr\^
.I Eofstr\^
is taken as the logical end-of-file string.
Underbar (\|_\|) is assumed for
the logical \fB\s-1EOF\s+1\fP string
if \fB\-e\fP is not coded.
\fB\-e\fP with no
.I eofstr\^
coded turns off the logical \fB\s-1EOF\s+1\fP string capability
(underbar is taken literally).
.I Xargs\^
reads standard input until either end-of-file or the logical \fB\s-1EOF\s+1\fP string is encountered.
.PP
.I Xargs\^
will terminate if either it receives a return code of
.B \-1
from,
or if it cannot execute,
.IR command .
When
.I command\^
is a shell program,
it should explicitly
.I exit\^
(see
.IR sh (1))
with an appropriate value to avoid accidentally returning with
.BR \-1 .
.SH EXAMPLES
The following will move all files from directory $1 to directory $2, and echo each move
command just before doing it:
.PP
.RS 10
ls \|$1 \|| \|xargs \|\-i \|\-t \|mv \|$1/{\|} \|$2/{\|}
.RE
.PP
The following will combine the output of the parenthesized commands onto one line,
which is then echoed to the end of file \fIlog\fP:
.PP
.RS 10
(logname; \|date; \|echo \|$0 \|$\(**) \|| \|xargs \|>>log
.RE
.PP
The user is asked which files in the current directory are to be archived
and archives them into \fIarch\fP (1.) one at a time, or (2.) many at a time.
.PP
.RS 10
1.\ \|\ \|ls \|| \|xargs \|\-p \|\-l \|ar \|r \|arch
.br
2.\ \|\ \|ls \|| \|xargs \|\-p \|\-l \|| \|xargs \|ar \|r \|arch
.RE
.PP
The following will execute
.IR diff "(1)"
with successive
pairs of arguments originally typed as shell arguments:
.PP
.RS 10
echo \|$\(** \|| \|xargs \|\-n2 \|diff

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Self explanatory.
