This message, whether generated by an unexpected interrupt or an
unrecognized response, may indicate either a software or hardware
problem.
First, check to see whether any unauthorized changes have been made
to the standard UNIX System tn85 device driver.
If so, this may be the problem and the driver should be restored
to its original source version.
If not, suspect hardware problems with the tn85 and contact your
support organization.
