.NM "\fIstring\fP on bad dev \fI#\fP(8)  \*(Do"
.Ds
A problem has been detected with a file system on a block type device
whose major device number exceeds the number of block device drivers
generated in the system.
The \fIstring\fP may be one of the following:
\fBbad block\fP, \fBbad count\fP, \fBbad free count\fP, \fBno space\fP, or \fBout of inodes\fP.
The \fI#\fP represents the minor device number.
.Ac
The main concern is that the major device number exceeds the number of
block device drivers generated in the system.
Probable causes for this include both software and hardware problems.
Check any new device drivers which have not been completely debugged
or any UNIX System device driver which has been modified without authorization.
Also, check that the configuration information in the system description
file is correct.
If none of the above apply, suspect bad hardware and contact your support
organization.
The corrective action for the file system problem can be found in the
action section for message:
