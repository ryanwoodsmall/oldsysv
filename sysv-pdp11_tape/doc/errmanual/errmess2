While attempting to dump to a tape mounted on a TU16 or TU78 tape drive,
an error occurred.
Note that the drive names TE16, TU45, and TU77 are aliases of TU16.
The first number given is the address of the block that was being

All numbers are given in hexadecimal.
For a TU16, the error register (MTER) is given.

On the PDP-11 and VAX, ``trap type'' will always be a number whose
description is given in the tables above.
On the 3B20S, ``trap type'' will be a one of the above descriptive
messages if the type was known to the UNIX System.
If not, it will be a number.
.Ac
Take a dump and reboot the system.
The dump should be analyzed, using the \fIcrash\fP(1M) command, in order
to identify the cause of the trap.
More information on this error can be found on the \fIcrash\fP(1M)
manual page in the \*(Am.
Probable causes include new device drivers which have not been completely
debugged, unauthorized modifications to existing UNIX System device drivers,
running out of system resources, incorrect or lack of information in
the system description file, and finally, hardware problems.
