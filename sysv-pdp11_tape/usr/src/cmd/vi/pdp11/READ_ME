This is version 2.15 of the editor. It is the same as 2.14 with a 
number of bugs fixed. Two enhancements that didn't make ex any bigger
were also added: allowing "%" to mean "1,$", and allowing the next
command to take a + argument like the edit command does.

Version 2.15 corresponds to version 3.7 without the enhancements in 3.7.
There is no reason to use 2.7 unless you have a pdp-11 that does not
have overlay software (type=ov insted of id), since 3.7 contains all
the bug fixes and some new features.

Note that the C source has been moved into the directory SCCS, and
a new tool has been added to `get' the files.

Special installation notes for 2.15:

1) The include file ../local/uparm.h does not need to be installed
anywhere.  
   
   The contents of this include file can be modified if you wish to 
   place the editor (and its string, recover tools) in a nonstandard 
   location.

2) Be sure to use the new termlib that goes with this version of 
the editor.

3) Be sure to use the new termcap.


Conditional compilation flags:
	-DTRACE		for debugging (wont then fit on an 11)
	-DV6		for version 6, using raw (v7 uses cbreak)
	-DVFORK		for UCB Vax/Unix with the vfork system call.
	-DCHDIR		compile in undocumented old chdir (cd) command
	-DLISP		compile in lisp hacks
	-DUCVISUAL	compile in code to handle \ escapes for
			visual on upper case only terminals.  gross.
	***** (see the makefile for more)

Ex means to avoid stdio like the plague. If any of stdio other than the
ctype.h functions or str* get pulled in, it is a mistake.

Ex is very large, but should fit (barely) on an 11/70.  There are only
a few bytes of room left in version 2.15 unless you take out some of
CHDIR, LISP, or UCVISUAL. This assumes the new termlib (which knows
about the tc= capability, 1024 byte entries, and @ cancellation of
capabilities.
