 * Capabilities from termcap
 *
 * The description of terminals is a difficult business, and we only
 * attempt to summarize the capabilities here;  for a full description
 * see the paper describing termcap.
 *
 * Capabilities from termcap are of three kinds - string valued options,
 * numeric valued options, and boolean options.  The string valued options
 * are the most complicated, since they may include padding information,
 * which we describe now.
 *
 * Intelligent terminals often require padding on intelligent operations
 * at high (and sometimes even low) speed.  This is specified by
 * a number before the string in the capability, and has meaning for the
 * capabilities which have a P at the front of their comment.
 * This normally is a number of milliseconds to pad the operation.
 * In the current system which has no true programmible delays, we
 * do this by sending a sequence of pad characters (normally nulls, but
 * specifiable as "pc").  In some cases, the pad is better computed
 * as some number of milliseconds times the number of affected lines
 * (to bottom of screen usually, except when terminals have insert modes
 * which will shift several lines.)  This is specified as '12*' e.g.
 * before the capability to say 12 milliseconds per affected whatever
 * (currently always line).  Capabilities where this makes sense say P*.

 * There are several kinds of tty drivers to contend with.  These include:
 * (1)	V6:		no CBREAK, no ioctl.  (Include PWB V1 here.)
 * (2)	V7 research:	has CBREAK, has ioctl, and has the tchars (TIOCSETC)
 *			business to change start, stop, etc. chars.
 * (3)	USG V2:		Basically like V6 but RAW mode is like V7 RAW.
 *			(We treat it as V6.)
 * (4)	USG V3:		equivalent to V7 but totally incompatible.
 *
 * The following attempts to decide what we are on, and declare
 * some variables in the appropriate format.  The wierd looking one (ttymode)
 * is the thing we pass to sTTY and family to turn "RAW" mode on or off
 * when we go into or out of visual mode.  In V7/V6 it's just the flags word
 * to stty.  In USG V3 it's the whole tty structure.
