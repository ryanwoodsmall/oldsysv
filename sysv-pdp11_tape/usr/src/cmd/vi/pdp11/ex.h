 * This file contains most of the declarations common to a large number
 * of routines.  The file ex_vis.h contains declarations
 * which are used only inside the screen editor.
 * The file ex_tune.h contains parameters which can be diddled per installation.
 *
 * The declarations relating to the argument list, regular expressions,
 * the temporary file data structure used by the editor
 * and the data describing terminals are each fairly substantial and
 * are kept in the files ex_{argv,re,temp,tty}.h which
 * we #include separately.
 *
 * If you are going to dig into ex, you should look at the outline of the
 * distribution of the code into files at the beginning of ex.c and ex_v.c.
 * Code which is similar to that of ed is lightly or undocumented in spots
 * (e.g. the regular expression code).  Newer code (e.g. open and visual)
 * is much more carefully documented, and still rough in spots.

 * case the editor needs a printf which prints through "putchar" ala the
 * old version 6 printf.  Thus we normally steal a copy of the "printf.c"
 * and "strout" code from the standard i/o library and mung it for our
 * purposes to avoid dragging in the stdio library headers, etc if we
