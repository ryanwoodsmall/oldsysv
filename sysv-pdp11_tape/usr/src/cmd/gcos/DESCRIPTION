#	@(#)DESCRIPTION	1.2
The dpd package consists of eight commands (or "spoolers") and
two daemons to send jobs from a unix over a dataphone or vpmc device to
GCOS, and possibly to bring files back from GCOS.

Communication with GCOS can be via one of 2 different hardware
devices, a DU11 or a KMC11-B, coupled with either a hardwired link
to GCOS or a high-speed line connected to an ACU and DN11 or to a
phone to be dialed manually.

The spoolers are:
	dpr		print a file on GCOS printer
	fget		get files from a GCOS directory
	fsend		send files to a GCOS directory
	gcat		send troff output to the phototypesetter
	gcosmail	send mail to a userid on GCOS
	ibm		send an off-line job to HO IBM 370
	labmake		print address labels on GCOS
	tekstare	convert tektronix picture to hard copy graphics

These spoolers create temporary files in a spooling directory,
and then activate one or more daemons to communicate between
the spooling directory and GCOS. 
The daemons are:
	dpd		sends jobs from unix to GCOS
	fget.demon	"gets" files from GCOS to unix.  This
			daemon is used only by fget.

The spoolers reside in /usr/bin.  The daemons reside in /usr/lib.
The spooling directory is /usr/spool/dpd.  To change the spooling directory
pathname, do a global edit (with printing) of all spoolers and daemons.
To change the pathnames of the daemons, only the spoolers and the
dpd daemon need to be edited.

Also included in this package are manual pages for ibm, labmake,
and tekstare (all in section 1c), a README file, and a make file,
gcos.mk, to install the package.


INSTALLATION

To install this package, follow the instructions in the README file.
Only 5 of the spoolers mentionned above (dpr, fget, fsend, gcat and
gcosmail) are officially supported.  If you want to use any of the
other spoolers (ibm, labmake or tekstare), you must add their names
to the dependency line

	spoolers:	dpr fget fsend gcat gcosmail

in the file gcos.mk before executing the make.


DESCRIPTION OF NORMAL WORKING OF DPD

Successful execution of any of the spoolers will produce (temporarily)
a file in /usr/spool/dpd with a name beginning with 'df' and ending with
the user's process-id, plus possible additional files with names
beginning with 'cf', 'lf', 'yf' or 'zf' and ending with the same process-id.
The dpd daemon will be automatically invoked also before the
spooler exits.  After dpd has sent this job to GCOS, all of the
df, cf, lf and yf files should disappear, and the success of the transaction
recorded by a line in the "errors" file. 'zf' files are generated only
by fget, and remain after dpd has sent the job until the fget.demon
has successfully retrieved the files from GCOS.  All successful transactions
and all errors are recorded in the errors file, /usr/spool/dpd/errors,
by both daemons. This file should be housecleaned occasionally,
to prevent it growing too large.

To fully automate the daemons, changes should be made to /etc/rc
to clean up the lock files from the spooling directory in case either
daemon was running when the system last went down, and to reinitiate
the dpd daemon in case there is any work left for it..

	rm -f /usr/spool/dpd/lock /usr/spool/dpd/glock
	/usr/lib/dpd

To automatically initiate the fget.demon periodically to check
if there are any files waiting to come over from GCOS, an entry
should be made in /usr/lib/crontab to initiate fget.demon every
so often (say 15 minutes), to run for a short period of time
just to check if there is anything to do..

	fget.demon 0

The argument to fget.demon tells it how many seconds to hang around
waiting for work, checking every minute or so.
The 0 makes it try only once.  A value of 20 makes it
wait 20 seconds, or 2 tries.  The default value is 6 minutes,
which is used by the fget spooler.

Files that will occasionally appear in the spooling directory
include:

	errors	log of all transactions; should be there always.
	snumb	latest GCOS snumb number used; should be there always,
			but it will be automatically
			recreated if it disappears.
	lock	lock file for dpd daemon; means dpd is running.
	glock	lock file for fget.demon; means fget.demon is running.
	logconfig  log of all changes of configuration, if automatic
			re-configuring is being used.  (See README file
			under AUTOMATIC RECONFIGURATION).

	dfWXXXXX  control file for a job waiting to be sent to GCOS.
			W is a letter identifying the spooler
			XXXXX is a process-id
	cfWXXXXX  copies of user files to be sent to GCOS.
	lfWXXXXX  links to user files to be sent to GCOS.
	yfWXXXXX  data from a tekstare job to be sent to GCOS.
	zfWXXXXX  links to user files to be retrieved from GCOS.
	tfWXXXXX  dfWXXXXX while it is still in the process of being made.
