This tape consists of bootblocks, root image, and cpio dumps of root, usr, doc,
man... I could find no machine or hardcopy of any sort for the installation
manual, but it shouldn't be too hard. It has prebuilt kernels that support
the general disk driver gd (RM02/03/05/80, RP04/06/06), rp (RP03/04),
tm (TM11/TU10) and ht (TU16/TE16). It should support 11/45 or 70's, but predatesthe J11 (PDP11/73..). I read the boot blocks, and it seems to support booting
from either a TM11 or TU16 controller, and then start an installation
program that will setup for various disk configurations.

	What is the most usefull way to send you the files? It can be
either the extracted and named sections, or a special file created by
a utility call 'copytape' that will recreate the original tape. The
extracted sections are listed below (size in 1024 byte blocks) :-
