.TH SETJMP 3C
.SH NAME
setjmp, longjmp \- non-local goto
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <setjmp.h>
.PP
.B int setjmp (env)
.B jmp_buf env;
.PP
.B void longjmp (env, val)
.B jmp_buf env;
.B int val;
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are useful for dealing with errors 
and interrupts encountered in
a low-level subroutine of a program.
.PP
.I Setjmp\^
saves its stack environment in
.I env\^
(whose type,
.IR jmp_buf ,
is defined in the
.I <setjmp.h>\^
header file), for later use by
.IR longjmp .
It returns the value 0.
.PP
.I Longjmp\^
restores the environment saved by the last call of
.I setjmp
with the corresponding
.I env
argument.
After
.I longjmp\^
is completed program execution
continues as if the corresponding call of 
.I setjmp\^
(which must not itself have returned in the interim)
had just returned the value
.IR val\^ .
.I Longjmp\^
cannot cause
.I setjmp\^
to return the value 0.  If
.I longjmp\^
is invoked with a second argument of 0,
.I setjmp\^
will return 1.
All accessible data have values as of the time
.I longjmp\^
was called.
.SH SEE ALSO
signal(2).
.SH WARNING
If
.I longjmp\^
is called when
.I env\^
was never primed by a call to
.IR setjmp ,
or when the last such call is in a function which has since returned,
absolute chaos is guaranteed.
