.TH PROFIL 2 
.SH NAME
profil \- execution time profile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B void profil (buff, bufsiz, offset, scale)
.br
.B char \(**buff;
.br
.B int bufsiz, offset, scale;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Buff\^
points to an area of core whose length (in bytes) is given by
.IR bufsiz .
After this call, the user's program counter (pc)
is examined each clock tick (60th second);
.I offset\^
is subtracted from it, and the result multiplied by
.IR scale .
If the resulting number corresponds to a word
inside
.IR buff ,
that word is incremented.
.PP
The scale is interpreted as an unsigned,
fixed-point fraction with binary point at the
left: 0177777 (octal) gives a 1-1 mapping of pc's to words
in
.IR buff ;
077777 (octal) maps each pair of instruction words
together.
02(8) maps all instructions onto the beginning of
.I buff\^
(producing a non-interrupting core clock).
.PP
Profiling is turned off by giving a
.I scale\^
of 0 or 1.
It is rendered
ineffective by giving a
.I bufsiz\^
of 0.
Profiling is turned off when an
.I exec\^
is executed, but remains on in child and parent both
after a
.IR fork .
Profiling will be turned off if an update in
.I buff\^
would cause a memory fault.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Not defined.
