.TH CREAT 2 
.SH NAME
creat \- create a new file or rewrite an existing one
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int creat (path, mode)
.br
.B char \(**path;
.br
.B int mode;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Creat\^
creates a new ordinary file or prepares to rewrite an existing file
named by the
path name
pointed to by
.IR path .
.PP
If the file exists, the length is truncated to 0 and the mode
and owner are unchanged.
Otherwise,
the file's owner
.SM ID
is set to the process's effective
user
.SM ID\*S,
the file's group
.SM ID
is set to the process's effective group
.SM ID\*S,
and
the low-order 12 bits of the file mode are set to the value of
.I mode\^
modified as follows:
.IP
All bits set in the process's file mode creation mask are cleared.
See
.IR umask (2).
.IP
The ``save text image after execution bit'' of the mode is cleared.
See
.IR chmod (2).
.PP
Upon successful completion, a non-negative integer,
namely the file descriptor,
is returned and the file is open for writing,
even if the mode does not permit writing.
The file pointer is set to the beginning of the file.
The file descriptor is set to remain open across
.I exec\^
system calls.
See
.IR fcntl (2).
No process may have more than 20 files open simultaneously.
A new file may be created with a mode that forbids writing.
.PP
.I Creat\^

is not a directory.
.SM
\%[ENOTDIR]
.IP
A component of the
path prefix
does not exist.
.SM
\%[ENOENT]
.IP
Search permission is denied on a component of the
path prefix.
.SM
\%[EACCES]
.IP
The path name is null.
.SM
\%[ENOENT]
.IP
The file does not exist and the directory in which the file
is to be created does not permit writing.
.SM
\%[EACCES]
.IP
The named file resides or would reside on a read-only file system.
.SM
\%[EROFS]
.IP

.SM
\%[ETXTBSY]

The file exists and write permission is denied.
.SM

.IP
The named file is an existing directory.
.SM
\%[EISDIR]
.IP
Twenty (20)

a non-negative integer,
namely the file descriptor,
is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.I errno\^
is set to indicate the error.
