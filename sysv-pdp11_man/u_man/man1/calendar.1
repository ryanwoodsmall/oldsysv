.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Calendar\^
consults the file \f3calendar\fP in the current directory
and prints out lines that contain today's or
tomorrow's date anywhere in the line.
Most reasonable month-day dates such as ``Dec. 7,''
``december 7,'' ``12/7,'' etc., are recognized, but not
``7 December' or ``7/12''.
On weekends ``tomorrow'' extends through Monday.

When 
an argument is present,

does its job for every user
who has a file \f3calendar\fP in their login directory

Normally this is done daily by facilities in the 
.SM UNIX
operating system.
