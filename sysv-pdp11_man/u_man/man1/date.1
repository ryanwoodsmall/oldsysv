.SH SYNOPSIS
.B date
[ mmddhhmm[yy] ]
[ \fB+\fPformat ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If no argument is given,
or if the argument begins with \fB+\fP,
the current date and time are printed.
Otherwise, the current date is set.
The first
.I mm\^
is the month number;\fR
.I dd\^
is the day number in the month;\fR
.I hh\^
is the hour number (24 hour system);\fR
the second
.I mm\^
is the minute number;\fR
.I yy\^
is the last 2 digits of the year number and is optional.
For example:
.PP
.RS
date\| 10080045
.RE
.PP
sets the date to Oct 8, 12:45 \s-1AM\s+1.
The current year is the default if no year is mentioned.
The system operates in \s-1GMT\s0.
.I Date\^
takes care of the conversion to and from
local standard and daylight time.
.PP
If the argument begins with \fB+\fP,
the output of
.I date\^
is under the control of the user.
The format for the output is similar to that of
the first argument to
.IR printf (3S).
All output fields are of fixed size (zero padded
if necessary).
Each field descriptor is preceded by \fB%\fP
and will be replaced in the output by
its corresponding value.
A single \fB%\fP is encoded by \fB%%\fP.
All other
characters are copied to the output without change.
The string is always terminated with a new-line character.
