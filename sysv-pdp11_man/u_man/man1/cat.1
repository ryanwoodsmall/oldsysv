.TH CAT 1
.SH NAME
cat \- concatenate and print files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cat
[
.B \-u
]
[
.B \-s
]
file .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cat\^
reads each
.I file\^
in sequence
and writes it on the standard output.
Thus:
.PP
.RS
cat file
.RE
.PP
prints the file, and:
.PP
.RS
cat file1 file2 >file3
.RE
.PP
concatenates the first two files and places the result on the third.
.PP
If no input file is given,
or if the argument
.B \-
is encountered,
.I cat\^
reads from the standard
input file.
Output is buffered unless the
.B \-u
option is specified.
The
.B \-s
option makes
.I cat\^
silent about non-existent files.
No input file may be the same as the output file unless it is
a special file.
.SH WARNING
Command formats such as
.RS
cat file1 file2 >file1
.RE
will cause
the original data in \fIfile1\fP to be lost,
therefore, take care when using shell special characters.
.SH SEE ALSO
cp(1), pr(1).
