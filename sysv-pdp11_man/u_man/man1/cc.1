cc, pcc \- C compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cc
[ option ] ... file ...
.br
.B pcc
[ option ] ... file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cc\^
is the \s-1UNIX\s+1 System C compiler.
.I Pcc\^
is the portable version for a \s-1PDP\s+1-11 machine.
They accept several types of arguments:
.PP
Arguments whose names end with \f3.c\fP are taken to
be C source programs; they are compiled, and
each object program is left on the file
whose name is that of the source with \f3.o\fP substituted
for \f3.c\fP.
The \f3.o\fP file is normally deleted, however, if a
single C program is compiled and loaded all at one go.
.PP
In the same way,
arguments whose names end with \f3.s\fP are taken to be assembly source programs
and are assembled, producing a \f3.o\fP file.
.PP
The following options are interpreted by
.I cc\^
and
.IR pcc .
See
.IR ld (1)
for link editor options and
.IR cpp (1)
for more preprocessor options.
.TP 8
.B \-c
Suppress the link edit phase of the compilation, and force
an object file to be produced even if only one program is compiled.
.TP
.B \-p
Arrange for the compiler to produce code
which counts the number of times each routine is called;
also, if link editing takes place, replace the standard startoff
routine by one which automatically calls
.IR monitor (3C)
at the start and arranges to write out a
.B mon.out
file at normal termination of execution of the object program.
An execution profile can then be generated by
use of
.IR prof (1).
.TP
.B \-f
Link the object program with the floating-point interpreter
for systems without hardware floating-point.
.TP
.B \-g
Cause the compiler
to generate additional information
needed for the use of
.IR sdb (1).
(Not for \s-1PDP-11\s+1\&.)
.TP
.B \-O
Invoke an
object-code optimizer.
.TP
.B \-S
Compile the named C programs, and leave the
assembler-language output on corresponding files suffixed \f3.s\fP.
.TP
.B \-E
Run only
.IR cpp (1)
on the named C programs, and send the result to the
standard output.
.TP
.B \-P
Run only
.IR cpp (1)
on the named C programs, and leave the result
on corresponding files suffixed \f3.i\fP.
.TP
.BI \-B string\^
Construct pathnames for substitute compiler,
assembler and link editor passes by concatenating
.I string\^
with the suffixes
.BR cpp ,
.B c0
(or
.B ccom
or
.BR comp ,
see under \s-1FILES\s+1 below),
.BR c1 ,
.BR c2 ,
.B as
and
.BR ld .
If 
.I string\^
is empty it is taken to be
.BR /lib/o .
.TP
.BR \-t [ p012al ]
Find only the designated compiler, assembler and link editor passes in the
files whose names are constructed by a
.B \-B
option.
In the absence of a
.B \-B 
option, the
.I string\^
is taken to be
.BR /lib/n .
.B \-t 
""
is equivalent to
.BR \-tp012 .
.TP
.BI \-W c,arg1[,arg2...]
Hand off the argument[s]
.I argi
to pass
.I c
where
.I c
is one of
.RB [ p012al ]
indicating preprocessor,
compiler first pass,
compiler second pass,
optimizer,
assembler,
or link editor, respectively.
.TP
.B \-d
This option is no longer allowed
because of a conflict of meaning.
The
.B \-W
option must be used
to specify precisely its destination.
To indicate the
.BI \-d n\^
option for the
.SM VAX
assembler,
use
.BI \-Wa,\-d n\^.
To indicate the
.B \-d
option for the
link editor,
use
.BI \-Wl,\-d .
.PP
Other arguments
are taken
to be either link editor option arguments,
C preprocessor option arguments,
or C-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier
.I cc\^
or
.I pcc\^
run,
or perhaps libraries of C-compatible routines.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are linked (in the order
given) to produce an executable program with the name
.BR a.out .

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by C itself are intended to be
self-explanatory.
Occasional messages may be produced by the assembler or the link editor.
Of these, the most mystifying are from the
.SM PDP\*S-11
assembler, in particular
.BR m ,
which means
a multiply-defined external symbol (function
or data).
