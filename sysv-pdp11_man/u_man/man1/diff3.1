.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diff3
[
.B \-ex3

file1 file2 file3
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Diff3\^
compares three versions of a file,
and publishes disagreeing ranges of text
flagged with these codes:
.RS
.TP 16
====
all three files differ
.TP 16
====1
.IR file1 " is different"
.TP 16
====2
.IR file2 " is different"
.TP 16
====3
.IR file3 " is different"
.RE
.PP
The type of change suffered in converting a given range
of a given file to some other is
indicated in one of these ways:
.RS
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " a"
Text is to be appended after line number
.I n1\^
in file
.IR f ,
where
.I f\^
= 1, 2, or 3.
.TP 16
.IB f " : " n1 " , " n2 " c"
Text is to be
changed in the range line
.I n1\^
to line
.IR n2 .
If 
.I n1\^
=
.IR n 2,
the range may be abbreviated to
.IR n1 .
.RE
.PP
The original contents of the range follows immediately
after a
.B c
indication.
When the contents of two
files are identical, the contents of the lower-numbered
file is suppressed.
.PP
Under the
.B \-e
option,
.I diff3\^
publishes a script for the editor
.I ed\^
that will incorporate into
.I file1\^
all changes between
.I file2\^
and
.IR file3 ,
i.e., the changes that normally would be flagged ==== and ====3.
Option
.B \-x
(\fB\-3\fR)
produces a script to incorporate
only changes flagged ==== (====3).
The following command will apply the resulting script to
.IR file1 .
.PP
