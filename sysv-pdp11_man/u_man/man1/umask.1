.TH UMASK 1
.SH NAME
umask \- set file-creation mode mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B umask
[ ooo ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The user file-creation mode mask is set to
.IR ooo .
The three octal digits refer to
read/write/execute permissions for
.IR owner ,
.IR group ,
and
.IR others ,
respectively
(see
.IR chmod (2)
and
.IR umask (2)).
The value of each specified digit is subtracted from the corresponding
``digit'' specified by the system for the creation of a file
(see
.IR creat (2)).
For example,
.B "umask 022"
removes
.I group\^
and
.I others\^
write permission
(files normally created
with mode
.B 777
become mode
.BR 755 ;
files created with mode
.B 666
become mode
.BR 644 ).
.PP
If
.I ooo\^
is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
.PP
.I Umask\^
is recognized and executed
by the shell.
