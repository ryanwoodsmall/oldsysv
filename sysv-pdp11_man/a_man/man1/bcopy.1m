bcopy \- interactive block copy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/bcopy
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Bcopy\^
dates from a time when neither the
.SM UNIX
System file nor the
.SM DEC
disk drives were as reliable as they are now.
.I Bcopy\^
copies from and to files starting at arbitrary block (512-byte) boundaries.
.PP
The following questions are asked:
.PP
.PD 0
.RS
.TP "\w@offset:\ \ \ @u"
.B to:
(you name the file or device to be copied to).
.TP
.B offset:
(you provide the starting ``to'' block number).
.TP
.B from:
(you name the file or device to be copied from).
.TP
.B offset:
(you provide the starting ``from'' block number).
.TP
.B count:
(you reply with the number of blocks to be copied).
.RE
.PD
.PP
After
.B count
is exhausted, the
.B from
question is repeated
(giving you a chance to concatenate blocks at the
.BR to + offset + count
location).
If you answer
.B from
with a carriage return, everything starts over.
.PP
Two consecutive carriage returns terminate
.IR bcopy .
