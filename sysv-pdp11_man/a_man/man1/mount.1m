.PP

special
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mount\^
announces to the system that a removable file system
is present on the device
.IR special .
The
.I directory\^
must exist already; it
becomes the name of the root of the newly mounted
file system.
.PP
These commands
maintain a table of mounted devices.
If invoked with no arguments,
.I mount\^
prints the table.
.PP
The optional last argument indicates that the file
is to be mounted read-only.
Physically write-protected and magnetic tape file
systems must be mounted in this way
or errors will occur when access times are updated,
whether or not any explicit write is attempted.
.PP
.I Umount\^
announces to the system that the removable file system previously
mounted on device
.I special\^
is to be removed.
.SH FILES
/etc/mnttab	mount table
.SH "SEE ALSO"
setmnt(1M),
mount(2),
mnttab(4).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.I Mount\^
issues a warning if the file system to be mounted
is currently mounted under another name.
.PP
.I Umount\^
complains if
the special file is not mounted or if it is busy.
The file system is busy if
it contains an open file or some user's working directory.
.SH BUGS
Some degree of validation is done on the file system, however
it is generally unwise to mount garbage file systems.
