.B df
[
.B \-t
]
[
.B \-f
] [ file-systems ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Df\^
prints out the number of free blocks
and free i-nodes
available for on-line file systems
by examining the counts kept in the
super-blocks;
.I file-systems\^
may be specified either by device name (e.g.,
.BR /dev/dsk1 )
or by mounted directory name (e.g.,
.BR /usr ).
If
the
.I file-systems\^
argument
is unspecified,
the free space on all of the
mounted file systems
is printed.
.PP
The
.B \-t
flag causes the total allocated block figures to be reported as well.
.PP
If the
.B \-f
flag is given,
only an actual count of the blocks in the
free list is made
(free i-nodes are not reported).
With this option,
.I df\^
will report on raw devices.
