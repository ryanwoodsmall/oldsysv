#	The following sed script is commented here.
#	The egrep pipe insures that we only have lines
#	that contain file names and the external
#	declarations associated with each file.
#	The first two parts of the sed script put the pattern
#	(in this case the file name) into the hold space
#	and creates the "filename filename" lines and
#	writes them out. The first part is for .o files,
#	the second is for .o's in archives.
#	The next 3 sections of code are exactly alike but
#	they handle different external symbols, namely the
#	symbols that are defined in the text section, data section
#	or symbols that are referenced but not defined in this file.
#	A line containing the symbol (from the pattern space) and 
#	the file it is referenced in (from the hold space) is
#	put into the pattern space.
#	If its text or data it is written out to the symbol definition
#	(symdef) file, otherwise it was referenced but not declared
#	in this file so it is written out to the symbol referenced
#	(symref) file.
