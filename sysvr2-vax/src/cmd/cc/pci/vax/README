These comments no longer apply, as the optim.c has been merged back
into the real common parts:

82/01/25:	Packaging for UNIX 5.0 release.

NOTE: This release of pci/vax requires its own copy of optim.c.  This was done
to postpone the decision of whether or not to include the change in the
official machine independent pci source (2.1).

The only conditional compilation of interest is the preprocessor name LOGFILE.
If this name is defined, code is defined to log the statistics generated on
peephole improvements on that file.  By default, it is not defined.  Its value
must include the C string delimiters (") at both ends.
