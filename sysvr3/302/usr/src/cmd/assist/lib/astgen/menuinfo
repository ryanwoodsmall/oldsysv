Type the layout as you want it to appear to the user.

Use % to indicate the description end and the beginning of a selectable item. 
Use # to indicate the end of a selectable and the beginning of a description.

NOTE: If you want a %, &, or # character to appear in your text, then you
      must take away the special meaning of the character by preceding
      it with a backslash.

      Avoid using the tab character in your layout file because it may
      cause alignment errors.

Here is an sample menu layout:

                       MENU TITLE

          %Batch, Background, and Execution Control

          kill#..... Terminate a process
