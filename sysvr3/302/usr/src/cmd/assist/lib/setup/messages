X 4 ASSIST_WALK_INTRO





                     INTRODUCTION TO ASSIST WALKTHRU

        
        ASSIST provides an introductory tutorial designed to walk you 
        through the basic concepts and commands that ASSIST uses.  The 
        tutorial takes about ten minutes, and many ASSIST users find it 
        helpful to take the tutorial before they begin using ASSIST.  









X 5 EXIT_ASSIST_WALK



        You have exited the Introduction to ASSIST walkthru.

        You can repeat the ASSIST walkthru at any time by:

            - Selecting the "ASSIST Walkthru" item from
              ASSIST's pop-up menu, 
            - Or by typing the command "assist -s"










X 6 HOW_TO_ACCESS_ASSIST_WALK



       If you want, you can use the ASSIST walkthru at any time by:

           - Selecting the "ASSIST Walkthru" item from
             ASSIST's pop-up menu, 

           - Or by typing the command "assist -s"













X 8 IDENTIFY_TERM





                     IDENTIFYING YOUR TERMINAL

        
        Your UNIX system contains files describing certain terminals.  
        This part will help you find out what terminal names your 
        system currently has information about.  











X 10 CONTROL_CHARS

                     CONTROL CHARACTERS


        ASSIST uses control characters to name some of
        the ASSIST commands. 




X 11 CTRL_C_NOTATION

                    CONTROL CHARACTER NOTATION


        ASSIST uses the caret (^) notation to display control characters. 
        For example, ^G means control-g.  




X 12 REV_1_CTRL_C

                   A REVIEW OF CONTROL CHARACTERS

     1. Control characters are special characters that are used
        by computers.  

        Locate the CONTROL key on your terminal. 

        NOTE: The CONTROL key is often located at the left part
              of your keyboard near the shift key.  It is
              usually labeled CTRL.  (Some keyboards have two
              control keys, one on each side; you can use either.)



     2. The CONTROL key is like a shift key.  Nothing happens when
        you strike the CONTROL key, or hold it down by itself.

        Push the CONTROL key down several times.  
        Notice that nothing happens.


X 13 REV_2_CTRL_C

     3. You enter a control character by pressing the CONTROL
        key down and striking another key while you hold the
        CONTROL key down. 

        For example, you enter the control-d character by
        holding down the CONTROL key and striking the 
        letter d 


X 20 INTRO_TO_TERM_CHECK

        
        
        For ASSIST to work correctly it must know the 
        capabilities of your terminal. 
        
        To check your terminal capabilities, I am going to
        show you some tests. Type one of these characters
        after each test:

        Type y if you see the pattern I describe.

        Type n if you see something wrong with the pattern.
        
        Type r if you would like to repeat the pattern.

                     A NOTE ABOUT TERMINAL CHECKING



        It is unlikely but possible that your screen may continue to 
        look wrong even after these test patterns are removed.  

        If you do have problems and all else fails, log off; turn off your
        terminal; and start again.  If you continue to have problems, consult
        Appendix C of the ASSIST User's Manual for further information.









Z
X 30 BASIC_CHECK




        
        The first test pattern will show you several changing screens 
        of characters.  At the end, the screen should just show the 
        word "assist" vertically.

        The pattern should look like this:
     

                           a
                           s
                           s
                           i
                           s
                           t


        You should not see extra characters (such as a % sign or
        letters), or missing characters.


X 41 STAND_OUT_CHECK
           
                  HIGHLIGHTING CHECK



        The test pattern that checks for highlighting has three lines.
        If your terminal has highlighting that ASSIST can use, the middle
        line of the test pattern will look different from either the
        first or the third line.











X 46 GRAPH_CHAR_CHECK

                   GRAPHICAL CHARACTER CHECK

        
        The test pattern that checks for graphical characters 
        is a rectangle.  

        
        If your terminal has a usable graphical character set, the 
        rectangle will be drawn with sharp continuous lines and 
        corners.  There must be no breaks in the rectangle.  
        
        
        If your terminal does not have a graphical character set, you 
        will see a rectangle composed of letters.  








X 50 FKEY_CHECK


                    CHECKING FUNCTION KEYS

        
        Many terminals have special keys called function keys.  These 
        keys are often located at the upper part of your keyboard.  
        They are frequently labeled f1 (for Function Key 1), f2 (for 
        Function Key 2), and so on.  
        
        









X 51 BAD_FKEYS

    Note that you can use ASSIST without function keys since you can enter
    all ASSIST commands with their control-character names.

    If you have a terminal with programmable function keys, then those keys
    should be set to send their default character sequences.  This is required
    before ASSIST can use the terminal's function keys.

    Appendix C of the ASSIST User's Manual contains more information on
    setting up terminals so that ASSIST can use the function keys.


X 60 END_TERM_CHECK


        This ends the checking of your terminal.


        You will be asked to check your terminal again only if 
          you use ASSIST with a new terminal type.
  
        If you want to recheck your terminal, use the command
          assist -s









X 100 TERM_IDENT_PROBLEM


                     TERMINAL IDENTIFICATION PROBLEM
        
        
         There appears to be a problem with identifying your terminal. 
         One possible reason is that your machine does not have a file
         describing your terminal.  Contact the administrator of your
         system to help you resolve this problem.



X 101 TERM_SPEC_PROBLEM
  Programs that require a visual display terminal need specific information
  about the terminal before the program can interact appropriately with the
  terminal.  There appears to be some type of problem with the information
  provided for your terminal.  This means that ASSIST may appear incorrectly
  on your terminal screen, and that other visual programs, such as the "vi"
  text editor, may also not display material correctly. 

  One possible reason is that you are using an incorrect name for your
  terminal.  Try using a different name to identify your terminal. 

  A second possible reason is that there is a problem with the file on your
  system that identifies the character sequences used by your terminal.  In
  this case, please contact the administrator of your system to help you
  resolve this problem. 

  A third possible reason is that you have your terminal's tabs set to
  something other than every eight spaces.  Try entering the command "tabs".
  Then try the command "assist" again.
