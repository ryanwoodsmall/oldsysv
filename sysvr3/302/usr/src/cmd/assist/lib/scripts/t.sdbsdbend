This ends the ASSIST "sdb" walkthru.  Try using "sdb" on your own.  Use 
the quick reference page for "sdb" in the appendix of the ASSIST User's 
Manual to remind yourself of the "sdb" commands you have learned in 
this walkthru.  

In addition to this ASSIST walkthru, you can learn about command line 
options for "sdb" from the ASSIST command form for "sdb."

If you forget how to do something, you can repeat the part of the ASSIST 
"sdb" walkthru that covers that subject.  When you feel comfortable 
with the commands that you have learned here, you should try other 
"sdb" commands that you can read about in the UNIX System V 
Programmer's Reference Manual.
