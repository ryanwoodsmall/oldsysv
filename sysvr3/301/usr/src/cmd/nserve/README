#ident	"@(#)nserve:README	1.6"
This directory contains the source for the name server.
Its home is $(ROOT)/usr/src/cmd/nserve.  To make the
name server, type make.  To install the name server,
type make install.  The install directory for the name
server program (nserve) is $(ROOT)/usr/nserve.

The biggest changes for N6 are some additional capabilities
for handling media independence.  These changes include a
new listener process, which will not be discussed here and
some changes to the rfmaster file.

As with previous versions, you should check the state of
several files in $(ROOT)/usr/nserve and /dev.  The following
commands will take care of the easy ones:

mknod /dev/spx c 127 39
rm /usr/nserve/nspid	# nserve will make what it wants as long as
			# nothing else is there.

The ones that you need to worry about are "rfmaster" and "dom.master."
rfmaster contains a reference to the domain name server in the
following format (Note: fields in brackets <> are variable fields,
the others are constant):

<domain>	p	<domain.ns>
<domain.ns>	a	<address>

<domain>	= the name of this machine's domain.
p		= keyword for record that defines a domain
		  name server.
<domain.ns>	= name of domain name server for <domain>
a		= keyword for record that defines address of
		  a machine.
<address>	= address of machine <domain.ns>, for 3bnet,
		  this is the ethernet address (in the form
		  \x0000000m800010xxxxxx0000, where m is the
		  minor device that the listener will use and
		  xxxxxx is a hexadecimal value that usually
		  corresponds to the machine's serial number).

For example:

sgs		p	sgs.sfjec
sgs.sfjec	a	\x000000028000104531000000

Note that the 34 that was previously part of the address has gone.
To avoid confusion, make sure that your addresses don't have the 34.
"dom.master" is a file in the same format that contains information
about other domains.  This file is optional, and if used at all, will
only be found on the primary name server.

See "Requirements for Distributed UNIX Administration--Issue 2,"
Dell'Aglio, et al. for more details.

The name server is started using the rfstart command, but several
things must be done first.  The normal sequence, starting from scratch
would be:

dname -d <domain_name>  # only really needed on first startup.
epump
pckd
nlsadmin -s <net_spec>  # net_spec will probably be npack
rfstart

In addition, you need to make sure that the program rfsetup is
in /usr/net and that it is executable.  When you run rfstart,
it will take several seconds to run, because there are several
operations that must take place, including some that may go
remote.  To stop things, run rfstop, which will get rid of
everything except listen and pckd, which must be killed
separately.
