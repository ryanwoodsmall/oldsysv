	Simple Administration software for AT&T 3B2 Computers (sadmin3b2)

UPDATING A PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED SIMPLE ADMINISTRATION
	If a previous installation of sadmin3b2 is in place
and you intend to replace that one with a new one, perform the following
sequence to remove the installed product, clobber intermediate files in the
source tree, remove the previous source files and remove the source tree
directory structure.  See the note about INSTALLING UNDER A DIFFERENT ROOT,
below.

		make -f sadmin3b2.mk ROOT=`pwd`/installdir remove clobber
		rm -f `make -f sadmin3b2.mk partslist`
		find * -type d -print  |  sort -r  |  xargs rmdir

Then install all the new source files and follow the instructions below.
It is possible to install new source without going through this sequence,
but there is a chance that it won't work because of name collisions and the
like.  This is guarenteed to give a clean sweep and properly build the product.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
All source files are installed under a single directory, traditionally
/usr/src/cmd/sadmin3b2.
All the product pieces are built by the issuing the command
		make -f sadmin3b2.mk

All the product pieces are installed by the super-user issuing the command
		make -f sadmin3b2.mk install

INSTALLING UNDER A DIFFERENT ROOT
The installation above installs releative to /.
The relative position of these files can be modified by adding a ROOT:
		make -f sadmin3b2.mk ROOT=`pwd`/installdir install

This will make the file in "installdir" below the current directory.
DO NOT set  ROOT=`pwd` !  It will wipe out your source!

CREATING DEVICE DIRECTORIES
The "harddisk" submenu depends on the existence of the directories
/dev/SA and /dev/rSA, which contain the block-special and the character-
special files for the file systems built-into the system.
Traditionally, these are known as /dev/SA/disk<number> where <number> is
1 and greater.
These files should be created by linking the appropriate /dev/dsk and
/dev/rdsk files into the /dev/SA and /dev/rSA directories.

The command /etc/disks is used to do this automatically when new disks are
configured on a 3B2.


MISCELLANEOUS make TARGETS
Note:
    All the following use the same ROOT conventions as "make install", above.

To list all product files created by "make install", type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk product

To list all product directories created by "make install", type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk productdir

To list all parts (delivered) files, type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk partslist

To list all commands used within Simple Administration shell scripts, type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk cmdsused

To clean out all intermediate files from the source directories (i.e. *.o), type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk clean

To clean out all intermediate and final product files
from the source directories, type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk clobber

To remove the product files from the installed directories, type
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk remove
(This must be done by the same user who issued  make install .)

NOTE:  Manual pages are also delivered with this package and is formatted
and installed separate from the software.  To format and install, type:
	make -f sadmin3b2.mk installdoc
(This also understands the ROOT keyword, same as above.)
