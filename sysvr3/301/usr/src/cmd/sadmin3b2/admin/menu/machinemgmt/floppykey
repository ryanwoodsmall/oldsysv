#menu# create a "floppy key" removable disk
#help# 
#help#	The "floppy key" removable disk allows you to enter firmware mode
#help#	if you have changed the firmware password and then forget what it is.
#help#	Thus the "floppy key" is just that, the "key" to your system and
#help#	should be protected as such.

Creating a floppy key requires you to take the system down and perform
a procedure found in the firmware monitor.  We will tell you what to do and
then take the system down for you.  You will then have to type the commands we
told you about.  The instructions are also in Chapter 4 of the Owner/Operator
Manual, "Making A Floppy Key" should you forget what we told you here.
You will need a floppy that is already formatted.  If you do not have one,
quit this procedure and issue the command:
		sysadm format
'
trap 'exit 0' 1 2  15
checkyn -f -k$$ -qq \
	'
(You will have another chance to abort this procedure.)
Do you want to take the system down and create a "floppy key"?'  ||
	exit 0
echo '
Be sure the floppy removable disk IS NOT WRITE PROTECTED!!
After these instructions, you will start the "firmware" procedure.  After
		SELF-CHECK
		FIRMWARE MODE
appear you should type the firmware password, which is
		mcp
if you have not changed it.  To the message
		Enter name of program to execute:
answer
		newkey
Follow the printed instructions.  
When the "Enter name of program to execute:" message reappears:
	<>	REMOVE THE DISK!!!
	<>	Press the OFF switch to turn off the power.
	<>	Press ON to restart UNIX.
We will now start the sequence to take the machine to firmware.  Type  q
to the next question to quit this whole process.
