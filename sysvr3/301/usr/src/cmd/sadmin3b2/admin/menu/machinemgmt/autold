#menu# set automatic boot device, default manual boot program

#help#
#help#	This procedure specifies the default manual program to boot from
#help#	firmware and/or the device to be used when automatically booting.

echo '
You may specify the default file for manual load, the device for auto load,
or both.

Typical files to be loaded are /unix, a fully configured UNIX, or /etc/system,
a system specification file.  The latter implies a self-configuration boot,
i.e.  the version of UNIX to be used will be generated as the system loads.
Note that the file name is not validated until boot time so make sure it is
correct.

Typical devices to be used for auto load are hard disks, e.g. HD30.
Note that the peripheral floppy cannot be used for auto load purposes.

	you request a "boot".
	If you reboot the system, you will then cause an automatic load from
	the device you just specified.

	be used when you turn the power back on.' \
