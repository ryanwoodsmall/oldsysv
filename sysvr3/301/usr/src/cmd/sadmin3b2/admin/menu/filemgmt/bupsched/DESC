#head#				BACKUP REMINDER SCHEDULING
#help#
#help#	Backup scheduling is used to schedule backup reminder messages
#help#	and backup reminder checks.  Backup reminder messages are
#help#	sent to the console to remind the administrator to backup
#help#	particular file systems when the machine is shutdown or a
#help#	reminder check has been run during the specified time period.
#help#
#help#	Backup reminder checks specify particular times at which the
#help#	system will check to see if any backup reminder messages
#help#	have been scheduled.
