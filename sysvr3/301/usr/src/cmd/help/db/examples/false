\Sfalse\S:  Example

This is an example of a use of \Sfalse\S.  It illustrates a loop that you
might use in a shell program.
                                count=0
                                until \Sfalse\S
                                do
                                     count=`expr "$count" + 1`
                                     echo "HELLO WORLD"
                                     if
                                             test "$count" -gt 59
                                     then
                                             break
                                     else
                                             sleep 10
                                     fi
                                done
         
The loop begins with "until \Sfalse\S." The value of "count" increases by one
with every pass through the loop.  This example prints "HELLO WORLD" and then
tests the value of "count".  If "count" is less than 60, then the program waits
10 seconds and prints "HELLO WORLD" again.  If "count" is greater than 59, the
inner loop ends and the outer loop ends when it executes break.
