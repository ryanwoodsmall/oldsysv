\Strue\S:  Examples

This is an example of a use of \Strue\S.  It illustrates a loop that you might
use in a shell program.
                           count=0
                           while  \Strue\S
                           do
                                 count=`expr "$count" + 1`
                                 echo "HELLO WORLD"
                                 if
                                       test "$count" -gt 59
                                 then
                                       break
                                 else
                                       sleep 10
                                 fi
                           done
    
The loop begins with "while \Strue\S".  The value of "count" increases by one
with every pass through the loop.  The program prints "HELLO WORLD" and tests
the value of the variable "count".  If "count" is less than 60, then the
program waits 10 seconds and prints "HELLO WORLD" again.  If "count" is greater
than 59, the inner loop ends, and the outer loop ends when it executes break.
