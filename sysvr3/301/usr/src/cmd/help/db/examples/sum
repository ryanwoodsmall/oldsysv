\Ssum\S:  Examples

        sum record

    Prints the file name and checksum for "record", and the number of 512 byte
    blocks of memory that "record" occupies.  If you transmit "record" to
    another system and then execute \Ssum\S again, you can check that "record"
    was transmitted without any errors.









    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        sum -r record labels

    Calculates the checksum and the number of 512 byte blocks of memory for the
    files "record" and "labels".  You use the alternate algorithm because
    "record" and "label" were transferred to your system from a UNIX System
    Version 7 system.  The algorithm used with the "r" option is compatible
    with the algorithm used by \Ssum\S on UNIX System Version 7 systems.  This
    allows you to compare the checksum values both before and after the files
    were transmitted to check that there are no errors.  \Ssum\S prints the
    information for each file on a separate line.








    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        grep -l account /SYSTEMS/* | xargs sum

    grep(1) searches through the directory "SYSTEMS" for files with the string
    "account" in them. The command xargs(1) executes \Ssum\S on each file
    that contains "account".  \Ssum\S prints a checksum, the number of 512
    byte blocks of memory, and the file name of each file.  This command is
    useful for checking that many files transferred without errors from one
    system to another.
