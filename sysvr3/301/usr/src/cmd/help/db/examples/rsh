\Srsh\S:  Examples

This line is similar to the entries in the /etc/passwd file, which is the file
that holds the records of the login names and passwords for users of the system.

demo::666:ssss:4444-P.Smith(333)r222:/q14/usr/demo:/bin/\Srsh\S

Because \Srsh\S appears in the listing the user with the login name "demo"
must work in a restricted shell.  The user is forced to work in the directory
"/q14/usr/demo".  He or she will not be able to change the PATH variable, and
will not be able to redirect standard output or standard error output.
