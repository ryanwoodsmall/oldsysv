        cmp prog1 prog2

   Compares the contents of two executable files "prog1" and "prog2".  Prints
   the line number and byte number of the first difference between the files.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        cmp - data2

   Compares standard input to the text file "data2".  The user signals the end
   of standard input by holding down the control key and striking the letter
   "d" simultaneously.  The output is the byte number where the first non-
   identical character occurs.

        cmp -l troff /usr/bin/troff

   Compares the file "troff" to "/usr/bin/troff" and lists the differences
   between the files in three columns of output.  The first column of output is
   a list of the bytes where the differences occur, and the second two are the
   octal representations of the characters that are different.
