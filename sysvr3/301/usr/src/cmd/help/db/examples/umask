        umask 022

   Changes the octal code that sets the access permissions for files you
   create.  Before this command was included in your .profile, the access
   permissions for your files might have been -rw-rw-rw-.  This mask changes
   the permissions to -rw-r--r-- which is read only for the group and other
   users.  The read and write permissions for the owner are not changed.
