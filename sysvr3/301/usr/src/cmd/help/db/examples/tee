\S tee \S:  Examples


       pr prog.c | tee progcopy

    Prints the contents of "prog.c" on the standard output and also places a
    copy of it in the file "progcopy".


    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       find . -print | tee list | cpio -o > /dev/tape

    Copies all the files under the current working directory to the file "list"
    and creates an archive on the tape "/dev/tape".


    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

       tee -ai script | sh -i 2>& 1 | tee -ai script

    Records all your input and output in the file "script".  The first \S tee \S
    records all of your input and stores it in the file script.  \S tee \S also
    sends this input to standard output which is used by sh(1) as input.  sh(1)
    executes the input and sends standard error output to "script".  The
    standard output is used as input to the second \S tee \S command.  \S tee \S
    sends its output to standard output and to the file "script".  If you want
    to stop recording your interactions in "script", you type control-d.
