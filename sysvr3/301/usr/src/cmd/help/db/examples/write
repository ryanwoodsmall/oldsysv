\S write \S:  Examples

    This is an example of how \S write \S is used.  First, you initiate the 
    conversation by typing \S write \S followed by another user's login name.
    The write command sends the user a message that says "MESSAGE FROM ABC".
    Then the other user knows to respond. Imagine that you typed the lines 
    that are highlighted, and the user you are writing to typed the other 
    lines.  You end each line with "o" to signal that this line is over.  
    When you want to end the conversation you tell the other user with "oo" 
    for over and out.  The conversation ends when you depress the control key
    and strike the letter d simultaneously.  This is called hitting control-d.
    \S write \S signals that the conversation is over by printing "EOT".

 
    \S write xyz \S

    MESSAGE FROM ABC
