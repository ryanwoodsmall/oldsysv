\Sline\S:  Examples

     This example is a shell program that gathers information about users.

        echo "ENTER YOUR NAME: \c"
        NAME=`line`
        echo "ENTER YOUR DEPARTMENT NUMBER: \c"
        DEPT=`line`
        echo "$NAME $DEPT >> personnel
     
     First, the program queries you for your name.  Because \Sline\S is
     surrounded by grave accents, the program executes it, and \Sline\S 
     reads the name and assigns the name to the variable "NAME".  Then 
     the program asks for your department and office extension.  The 
     program assigns these values to "DEPT" The last line
     appends "NAME"and "DEPT" to the file "personnel".
