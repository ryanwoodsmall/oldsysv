\Spasswd\S:  Examples

   asks you what your old password was and what you would like to change it to.
   Then it changes your password.

        passwd mqb

   Starts conversation between the user "mqb" and the \Spasswd\S program.  It
   asks what the old password was, what he or she would like to change it to,
   and then it changes the password.  This is useful when the user has two
   logins on the same system and he or she wants to change the password without
   logging off and logging on again.
