       pwd

    Prints the full path name of the current working directory to the standard
    output.  For a user on system "a8" with a login directory "xyz" who is
    working in her login directory, the output of this command is "/a8/xyz".

       cd EXPERIMENT; PATH=$PATH:`pwd`; cd $HOME

    Moves you to the "EXPERIMENT" directory and changes the value of your 
    "PATH" variable to include "EXPERIMENT".  Then cd(1) makes your "HOME" 
    directory your current working directory.  With "PATH" redefined, you can
    execute any files that are in "EXPERIMENT" from your "HOME" directory or
    any other directory.
