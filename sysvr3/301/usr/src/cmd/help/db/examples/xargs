\S xargs \S: Examples

        ls|xargs -n1 -t sum

    \Sxargs\S takes one file name at a time from the list of file names from
    the current directory and uses it as input to the sum(1) command.  When
    sum(1) is executed, \Sxargs\S prints "sum file_name" followed by the
    checksum and number of blocks for the file.









    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    You would use \Sxargs\S in the following command line to execute diff(1)
    several times, each time comparing "record" to a different file.

        \Sxargs -t -irpl diff record rpl \S

    \Sxargs\S waits for you to type a file name that it can substitute for
    "rpl" on the command line. If you type

        \S record2 \S

    diff(1) compares "record" to "record2".  \Sxargs\S prints

        diff record record 2

    and then it prints the output of diff(1).  After the output, \Sxargs\S
    waits for another file name to replace "rpl".  
    If you do not want to compare any more files, you type a control 
    character and the letter "d" simultaneously and \Sxargs\S will terminate.

        \S control-d \S
