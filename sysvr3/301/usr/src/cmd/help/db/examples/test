\Stest\S:  Examples

        test -r exercise.1

   Tests the expression "-r exercise.1".  Checks if the file "exercise.1"
   exists and is readable.  If it exists and is readable, then \Stest\S sets
   the exit status to zero.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        [ "$a" = "yes" ]

   Checks if the value for the variable "a" is the string "yes".  If it is,
   \Stest\S sets the exit status to zero.

   The following is an example of \Stest\S in a shell program.

         if
             \Stest\S -s exercise.1
         then
             pr exercise.1
         fi

   The \Stest\S in this shell program tests the expression "-s exercise" which
   checks if "exercise.1" is a file with at least one character.  If it is, the
   program prints the file; if it is not a file, or if it is empty, the program
   does not print the file.
