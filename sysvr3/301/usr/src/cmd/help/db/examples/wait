\Swait\S:  Examples

     This is an example of a shell program that uses \Swait\S.


         mm def > def.m &
         mm def2 > def2m &
         wait
         cat def.m def2.m > def all

  
     This shell program formats "def" and "def2", and stores the formatted
     files in "def.m" and "def2.m".  \Swait\S delays the execution of the
     cat(1) command until "def" and "def2" are finished formatting.


     
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     This example shows you how you use \Swait\S outside of a shell program.
     You execute a command to format the file "book.1" in the background.  You
     store the formatted file in "book.1.m".

         \S mm book.1 >  book.1.m & \S

     After the command is executed, the system prints the process ID of the
     background process.  For example, the process ID is any integer between 0
     and 32000, and it might be:

         2146

     You also want to format several other files.  You execute them in the
     background and redirect their output.  The shell returns a process ID for
     each of these also.

         \S mm thesis > thesis.m & \S
         2710
         \S mm fiction > fiction.m & \S
         2794
  
     You type \Swait\S followed by the "2146" so that the system does not
     return a prompt until "book.1" is finished formatting.

         wait 2146

     When the system prints a prompt, you know "book.1" is finished formatting
     and you can type a command line that compares an old file "book.m" to the
     newly formatted file, "book.1.m".

         \S comm book.m book.1.m > changes & \S
