\Sdircmp\S:  Examples

        dircmp SOURCE SOURCE.2

    Compares the two directories, "SOURCE" and "SOURCE.2".  Prints the files
    that are unique to each directory, and identifies files that have the same
    name and identical or different contents.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        dircmp -s SOURCE SOURCE.2

    Compares the files in the directories "SOURCE" and "SOURCE.2".  Lists the
    files that are unique to each directory, and the files with the same name
    but different contents.  Suppresses the printing of file names that have
    identical contents.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        dircmp -d -w80 SOURCE SOURCE.2

    Compares the files in "SOURCE" and "SOURCE.2".  Lists the files that are
    unique to each directory, files with identical or different contents, and
    creates scripts to make different files identical. \Sdircmp\S truncates
    the output lines so they are only 80 characters long.
