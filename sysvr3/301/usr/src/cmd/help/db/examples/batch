\Sbatch\S:  Examples

    The following is an example of how you can execute a command using
    \Sbatch\S    \Sbatch\S.  If you type \Sbatch\S and a carriage return,
    \Sbatch\S waits for a command from standard input.

        \Sbatch\S

    Then if you want to format a file, you type:


        \S mm -r08 -Tlp -c chapter1 > format.ch1 \S.

    \Sbatch\S waits for more input until you type a control character and the
    letter "d" simultaneously.

        \S control-d \S
    
    \Sbatch\S prints the job number, and executes the command when the
    system's work load is not heavy.  You will receive a message through 
    mail(1) when the job is finished.
