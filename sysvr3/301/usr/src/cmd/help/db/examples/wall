    After you type \S wall \S and a carriage return, everything that follows is
    saved to be sent to current system users.  Unless you are super user, users
    who have turned off the write access for their terminals will not receive
    the message.  The message is sent after you depress the control key and
    strike the letter d simultaneously.  This is called control-d.
