\Scat\S:  Options

     -s   suppresses messages about non-existent files.

     -u   does not place output in a buffer before it prints it.

     -v   prints characters that are normally non-printing characters (e.g.,
          "^G" is printed for the bell character).  (Does not print tabs, new
          lines or form-feeds.)

     -e   prints a "$" character at the end of each line.  Only useful with the
          "v" option.

     -t   prints tabs as "^I". Only useful with the "v" option.
