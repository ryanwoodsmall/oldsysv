\Sps\S:  Options

     -a   prints the basic information about all process linked to a terminal.

     -d   prints all the basic information except process group leaders.

     -e   prints the basic information about all processes.

     -f   generates a full listing including the 1) userID; 2) processID 
          number; 3) processID of the parent process; 4) scheduling 
          information; 5) process starting time; 6) the tty number of the 
          terminal; 7) the time the command took to execute ; and 
          8) the command and its options.

     -l   generates a long listing that contains 1) a flag that, for example,
          states whether the process is a parent or child; 2) a status that
          gives information on whether the process is waiting, running, or
          swapped; 3) the priority; 4) a nice value; 5) memory address of the
          process; 6) size; 7) and wait channel which is the memory address 
          of the process that the shell is waiting on to finish.

    -c alternate_mem   uses <alternate_mem> in place of /dev/mem.  (See the
                         manual page for \Sps\S for details on /dev/mem.
                         Not available on the 3b2.)

     -g grp_list   only prints the data about processes whose process group
                  leaders are given in <grp_list>.  Group leaders are integers
                  that are the names of processes that are parents of other
                  processes, i.e. your login shell.  They are  separated
                  by commas, spaces, or both.

     -n name_list  replaces system name_list file "/unix" with the <name_list>.
                   Names are separated from one another by commas, spaces, or
                   both.

     -s alternate_swap  uses <alternate_swap> in place of /dev/swap.  (See the
                        manual page for \Sps\S for details on /dev/swap.  
                        not available on the 3b2.)

     -t term_list  prints only the data about terminals listed in <term_list>.
                   Terminal identifiers are separated from one another by
                   commas, spaces or both.
