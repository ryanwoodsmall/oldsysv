\S sort: \S  Options

     -m   merges files that ar already sorted.

     -u   eliminates duplicate lines in the output.

     -c   checks that input file is sorted according to ordering rule, and
          prints a message the includes the file name and the term "disorder"
          if the lines of the file are ordered incorrectly.

     -M   considers the first three non-blank characters of a field to be the
          names of months.  Compares and orders them as JAN < FEB < ... < DEC.

     -b   ignores leading blanks in restricted field comparisons.  If you use
          "b" before <+position1> on the command line, the option is applied
          to every restricted field.  You can ignore blanks in specific
          fields by listing "b" after <+position1> and/or <position2>.
          

     -d   letters, digits and blanks are used when sorting lines.  Can be
          attached to <position1> or <position2>.

     -f   maps lower case letters onto upper case.  Can be attached to
          <position1> or <position2>.

     -i   ignores characters outside ASCII range in non-numeric comparisons.
          Can be attached to <position1> or <position2>.

     -n   sorts an initial numeric string by arithmetic value.

     -r   sorts in reverse order.

     -o output_file   writes the output of the sort to <output_file> instead 
                      of standard output.


     -tchar   <char> is the field separator character.  The default field 
               separator is a blank space.

     -ymemory  uses <memory> kilobytes of memory instead of the default memory
               size. "y" alone uses the maximum memory from the start.
               (Useful only with "c" and "m" options.)

     -zsize   <size> is the size of the longest line. Useful for avoiding
               abnormal terminations.  (Useful only with "c" and "m" options.)

     +position1   <position1> is starting position of \Ssort\S.  Normally,
                  the sort begins in the 1st field with the 1st character.  By
                  specifying a position, you can change the starting place of
                  the sort.  <position1> takes the form "m.n" where "m" and "n"
                  are integers.  The value of "m" specifies how many fields to
                  skip before starting the sort. The "n" specifies the number
                  of characters in the field before starting the sort.
                  The default for "n" and "m" is 0, so sorting begins at the 
                  1st character of the 1st field.



     -position2   <position2> is ending position for \Ssort\S.  Normally,
                   the sort stops at the end of the line.  With <position1> and
                   <position2> you can sort from a character you specify in
                   <position1> up to and including the character you specify
                   with <position2>.  For <position2>  "m.n" means end the 
                   sort on character "n" in field "m".
