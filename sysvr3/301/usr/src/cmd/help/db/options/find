\Sfind\S:  Options

     \Sfind\S does not have any options.

     \Sfind\S does use logical expressions for arguments.  Logical expressions
     can be used alone or in combination with one another.  Two logical
     expressions separated by a blank space are related by logical "and".  Two
     logical expressions separated by "-o" are related by logical "or".  A "!"
     preceding a logical expression is a logical negation of the expression.
     \Sfind\S also enables you to group expressions using parenthesis, (), but
     you must precede each parenthesis with a "\".  The following is a list of
     the possible logical expressions:


     -name file_name   searches for file named <file_name>.

     -perm octal_code  searches for files with <octal_code> permissions.
 
     -type file_type   searches for files of type <file_type>, where
                       <file_type> is one of the following:  b for block
                       special; c for character special; d for directory; p
                       for named pipe; or f for ordinary file.
     -links n    searches for files with <n> links.
     -user userID    searches for files that are owned by the user with
                     <userID> which is a login name or numeric user ID.
     -group groupID  searches for files belonging to a group where <groupID>
                     is a group name or numeric group ID.
     -size n [c]    searches for files of size <n> blocks long, or <n>
                    characters if you include "c".
     -atime n   searches for files that have been accessed within <n>
                days.
     -mtime n   searches for files whose contents have been modified
                within <n> days.
     -ctime n   searches for files whose modes have been changed within
                <n> days.


     -exec command    executes <command>.  The argument {} means that the
                      path name that is matched by find is replaced by the
                      current path name.
     -ok command      like "-exec", but prints <command> and executes it only
                      if user responds with "y" for yes.
     -print         prints path names of files that it identifies.
     -cpio device     copies files to <device>.
     -newer file_name   searches for files whose data has been modified more
                        recently than <file_name>.
     -depth         acts upon all entries of a directory before the
                    directory itself.
