\Stabs\S:  Options

     -arbitrary   <arbitrary> is a string of integers separated by commas.
                  Each integer is added to the last integer to set the tab 
                  stops.  (i.e., 1, +7, +4, +4, +4, +35 is the same as the 
                  tab stops for COBOL, normal format 1, 8, 12, 16, 20, 55.) 
                  This enables you to set tabs that are any distance apart.

     -canned   <canned> is a one or two letter code that designates tab 
               settings for a normal format for a computer language.  
               The following is a list of choices for <canned>:

               a     Assembler, IBM S/370, first format, 1, 10, 16, 36, 72
               a2    Assembler, IBM S/370, second format, 1, 10, 16, 40, 72
               c     COBOL, normal format, 1, 8, 12, 16, 20, 55
               c2    COBOL, compact format, 1, 6, 10, 14, 49


               c3    COBOL, compact format with more tabs,
                     1, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 
                     58, 62, 67
               f     FORTRAN 1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23
               p     PL/I 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37,
                     41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61
               s     SNOBOL 1, 10, 55
               u     UNIVAC 1100 Assembler 1, 12, 20, 44

     -repetitive   <repetitive> is an integer that sets tabs at
                   1 + <repetitive>, 1 * 2 <repetitive>, etc.  This sets tabs at
                   regular intervals.

     +mmargin      moves the margin over <margin> columns.  The default is 10.




     -Tterminal_type   sets the tabs as they would normally be set for a
                       <terminal_type> terminal.  Valid terminal types are
                       listed in the UNIX System Programmer's Reference manual
                       on the manual page for tabs(5).

     --file_name   sets tab stops to the tab specification on the first line of
                   <file_name>.  The format for tab specification includes the
                   options for \Stabs\S, surrounded by angle brackets and
                   colons, "<:    :>".  The default is every 8 characters.
