\Ssh\S:  Options

     -a   exports the variables that \Ssh\S modifies or creates.

     -e   exits immediately if a command does not execute successfully.

     -f   prohibits pattern matching for file names.  (glossary(1) describes
          regular expressions and special characters that are used in pattern
          matching.)

     -h   locates and records commands that are in a program when you define
          the program as a function.

     -i   executes commands interactively and ignores signals to TERMINATE,
          INTERRUPT, and QUIT.


     -k   puts all keyword arguments in the environment, not only those that
          precede a command.

     -n   reads and checks the syntax of a shell script but does not execute it.
     -r   uses a restricted shell.

     -t   reads and executes only one command.

     -u   prints a message if a shell variable is not initialized when \Ssh\S
          attempts a variable substitution.

     -v   prints shell input lines as it reads them.

     -x   prints commands and arguments as \Ssh\S executes them.  This option
          is useful when debugging shell scripts.

     

     -c command ...   executes the shell command or commands in the string
                      <command>.  You must separate each command from the next
                      with ";".

     -s   creates a new shell and reads commands from standard input and sends
          the output to standard output.  Assigns each argument on the command
          line, up to seven arguments, to a positional parameter.  Positional
          parameters can be used as arguments to commands.
