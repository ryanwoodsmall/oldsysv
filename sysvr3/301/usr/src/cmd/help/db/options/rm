     -f   Removes files that you do not have write permission for without 
          asking any questions.

     -i   interactive option.  Asks you whether each file should be removed.
          If you respond "y", the file is removed.  If you respond "n", 
          the file is not removed.

     -r   recursive option.  Removes contents of the named directories and 
          their subdirectories, and then removes the directory itself.
