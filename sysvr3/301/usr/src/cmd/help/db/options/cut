     -c char_list      <char_list> specifies a list of character position
                       numbers to cut on.  Each number is separated by commas,
                       and "-" indicates ranges.

     -f field_list     <field_list> specifies a list of field position numbers
                       to cut on.  Each number is separated by commas, and "-"
                       indicates ranges.

     -d char   sets field separator to <char>. (A tab character is the
               default).  Characters with special meaning to the shell, must be
               quoted.

     -s   suppress the printing of lines that do not have field separators.
