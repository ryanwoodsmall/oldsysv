\Smail\S:  Options

     -F   forwards mail messages.  Start forwarding using "F" and one or more
          <login_name>.  Messages will be forwarded to the user with
          <login_name>.  Mail can be forwarded to a user on a remote system by
          preceding <login_name> by <system_name!> which is the system name of
          a remote system followed by a "!".  End forwarding using the "F" and
          double quotes " ".  Note:  Before you can forward your mail, your
          /usr/mail file must be empty.

     -o   turns off path optimization. Normally, \Smail\S delivers mail 
          using the path that requires the fewest network hops.  This option
          turns off that function.

     -t   prints a "TO:" list that precedes the mail message.  The list 
          contains the names of all the users who received the mail.

     -e   tests for the presence of mail and sets the exit code to 0 if you 
          have mail and 1 if you do not.

     -h   prints the headers for the first 6 messages in your /usr/mail file.
          After printing the headings, it leaves you in interactive mode where
         you can choose to read mail messages.  See the interactive commands on
         the manual page for \Smail\S.
  
     -p   prints mail without prompting you to save or dispose of it.  If you
          have mail, it sets the exit code to 0.

     -q   terminates mail after you hit the interrupt key.

     -r   prints mail in first-in, first-out order.

     -f file_name   prints mail from <file_name> rather than from file in the
                    /usr/mail/ directory that is named by your login name.
