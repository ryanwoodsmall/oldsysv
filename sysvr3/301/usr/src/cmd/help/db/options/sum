\Ssum\S:  Options

     -r   calculates the checksum using an alternate algorithm which is
          compatible with the \Ssum\S command for UNIX System Version 7.  By
          using this algorithm as well as the default algorithm, you can
          increase your confidence in the fact that a file transmitted without
          errors.
