\Sred\S:  Options

     -   suppresses the printing of character counts from the "e", "r", and "w"
         commands, and diagnostics from the "e", and "q" commands.

     -x   makes it possible to edit encrypted files.  (This option is only
          available on domestic releases of UNIX systems.)

     -p string   specifies <string> as the prompt.  Normally, \Sred\S does not
                 provide a prompt.
