\Scpio\S:  Options

     -i   extracts archived files from <archive_file> and unarchives them into
          the current directory.

     -o   copies files out of a directory, archives them, and sends the archive
          to standard output.

     -p   passes files to <dir_name>.  It does this by copying, archiving,
          moving, and unarchiving them.  This option never produces a permanent
          archive file.

Either "o", "i", or "p" must be present to use the following:

     B   blocks input or output in 5,120 byte records.



     S   swaps the half words order.  Different computers access and store
         non-character data differently.  Use this option when the computer
         <archive_file> was created on has a different half word order than the
         computer you are unarchiving it on.
     
     s   swaps the byte order.  See the "S" option.

     a   resets the access times for input files.

     b   swaps both the byte order and half word order.  Different computers
         access and store non-character data differently.  Use this option when
         the computer <archive_file> was created on has a different byte order
         and half word order than the computer you are unarchiving it on.

     c   creates header information in ASCII codes for portability.



     d   creates directories and subdirectories as necessary. Normally,
         \Scpio\S does not archive files that are in subdirectories of the
         directory you are archiving.

     f   copies all files except those specified by <pattern>.

     l   links files in the new directory to those in the old directory rather
         than making copies for the new directory.

     m   retains the file modification time from when \Scpio\S created the
         archive.  Normally, the modification time for a file changes when you
         unarchive it or pass it to another system.

     r   renames files interactively. If the user does not type a new file
         name, it uses the current file name.

     t   prints a table of contents without unarchiving the files.

     u   unconditionally replaces a new file with an older file when both files
         have the same name.

     v   prints a verbose list of file names in <archive_file>.  When used with
         "t" it resembles the output of "ls -l".
