     -a   lists all entries, including those beginning with a dot.

     -m   prints entries on one line, one after another, separated by commas.

     
     -n   same as "l" except the owners user ID number and the group's group ID
          number are printed rather than the owner's login name and the group's
          name.

          group name.

     -p   places a slash after filename if file is a directory.

     -q   prints non-graphic characters in the file names as "?".

     -r   reverses the order of the output.  Order will be reverse alphabetical
          order unless you use "c", "t", or "u" options.

     -t   sorts and prints by time of last modification (latest first) instead
          of alphabetically.
