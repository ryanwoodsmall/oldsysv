\Spack\S:  Options

     -   reports details of the packed files: reports the percent that the
         file was compressed, the savings in bytes, the structure of the
         recoded file, the number of different characters in the input, the
         number of characters used to recode the file, the number of bits of
         information that are coded in every byte, and the theoretical number
         of bits that could have been coded per byte.

     -f   forces a files to pack when they are smaller than three blocks.
