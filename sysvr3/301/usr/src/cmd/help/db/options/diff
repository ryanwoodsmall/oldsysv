\Sdiff\S:  Options

     -b   ignores trailing blanks, and treats other strings of blanks as if
          they were equal in length.

     -e   produces scripts for ed(1) that change <file_name1> into <file_name2>.

     -f   produces a script that is the inverse of the "e" option.  It lists
          changes that would make <file_name2> identical to <file_name1>.
          (This script can not be used by ed(1).)

     -h   works quickly and on big files.  If the differences are only
          separated by a few lines, this option lists the lines that are
          different and the lines that separate them.  If the differences are
          well separated, the output is the same as it is for \Sdiff\S without
          options.
