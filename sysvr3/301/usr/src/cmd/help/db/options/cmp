\Scmp\S:  Options

     -l   lists the output in three columns.  In the first column is the byte
          number where the difference between the files occurs.  In the second
          and third columns are the octal representations of the two characters
          that differ.

     -s   changes the exit status:  0 means the files are identical, 1 means the
          files differ, and  2 means the files are omitted or are not
          accessible.  With this option \Scmp\S produces no output.
