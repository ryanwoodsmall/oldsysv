\Sed\S:  Options

     -   suppresses the printing of character counts from the "e", "r", and "w"
         commands, diagnostics from the "e", and "q" commands, and the "!"
         prompt after "! command" is executed.

     -x   makes it possible to edit encrypted files.  (This option is only
         available on domestic releases of UNIX systems.)

     -p   string specifies <string> as the prompt.  Normally, \Sed\S does not
          provide a prompt.
