\Sxargs\S:  Options


     -p   prints the command line that \Sxargs\S will execute, and prompts you
          to respond.  A "y" response causes \Sxargs\S to execute the command.
          Any other response causes \Sxargs\S to skip the command.  You can
          terminate \Sxargs\S by holding down the control key and striking the
          letter "d" simultaneously.


     -t   traces <command> as it executes.  Prints <command> and arguments
          before the output.


     -x   terminates <command> if any argument list is greater than the <size>
          option argument for the "s" option.



     -estring   treats <string> as the end of file string.  If you don't use the
                "e" option and <string>, the end of file character is an
                underbar, "_". If you use "e", but you do not designate
                <string>, underbar is no longer the default end of file string.
                \Sxargs\S reads arguments from standard input until it hits
                the end-of-file string or there are no more arguments to read.
       
     -ireplace   Use <replace> as an argument on the command line.  \Sxargs\S
                 executes the command once for every line of standard input and
                 the value of the line from standard input is substituted for
                 every occurrence of <replace> on the command line.  Up to five
                 arguments on the command may contain one or more occurrences
                 of <replace>.



     -llines   executes <command> using the next <lines> lines of arguments
               from standard input. \Sxargs\S executes the command until 
               all of the lines have been used.

     -nnumber   executes <command> with up to <number> arguments from standard
                input. Ignores <size> limitations unless you also use the "x"
                option.

     -ssize   sets the maximum size of each argument list to <size>, which is
              any positive integer up to 470.  The default for <size> is 470.
