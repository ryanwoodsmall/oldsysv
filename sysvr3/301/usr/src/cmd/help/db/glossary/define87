\S inode: i-number:  inode number \S

Inode stands for information node.  An inode stores the administrative
information for a file.  This is information on how long the file is, where
it is stored on the disk, the time when the file was last written (write
time), read or executed (usage time), and changed (change time).  The
system organizes files according to their inode numbers or i-numbers which
are integers that identify the inodes.  Files that are linked have the same
i-number. The ls(1) command has options that print the i-numbers, and
write, usage and change times for your files.
