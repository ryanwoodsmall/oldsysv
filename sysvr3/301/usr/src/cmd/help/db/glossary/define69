\S abnormal termination \S

When a command does not finish executing normally, it terminates
abnormally.  When abnormal termination occurs, the command started to
execute then something went wrong to make it stop before it finished.  For
example, if you use names of non existent files as input to a command, the
command terminates abnormally because it will not have any input. You can
cause a command to terminate abnormally using the kill(1) command, or by
hitting the delete or break key while it is executing.
