\S link \S

A link is the association between a "file name"\S*\S and a file.
Normally, a file has only one name linked to it.  But a file can have
many names, thus it can have many links. Accessing a file through
any one of the  links, by using one of the file names, produces the
same result as accessing it through any of the other file names.
