\S special character \S

A special character is a non-alphanumeric character that has 
meaning to the shell other than its literal meaning. "Asterisk(*)"\S*\S,
"dot(.)"\S*\S, "ampersand(&)"\S*\S, "question mark(?)"\S*\S, "backslash(\)"\S*\S, 
"pipe(|)"\S*\S, and "pound sign (#)"\S*\S are some of the special characters.
Some special characters are used for matching "file names"\S*\S.  For example,
the "asterisk(*)"\S*\S in the "string"\S*\S "*save" in command line 

	rm *save

causes "tempsave", "memosave", and "lettersave", and any other
file names  in the directory that end in "save" to be deleted.
Special characters  are decsribed on the "manual page"\S*\S for the
shell command, sh(1).
