\S file name:  simple file name \S

A file name is a "string"\S*\S of characters that identifies a file.  A
file name can be a simple file name which is the name of the file when the
file is in your current working directory.  A simple file name can not be
more than 14 characters long, and can not contain a "pipe (|)"\S*\S
character.  A file name can also be the relative pathname or full pathname 
of a file.  Files with the same name can exist in different
directories, but file names within the same directory must be unique.
