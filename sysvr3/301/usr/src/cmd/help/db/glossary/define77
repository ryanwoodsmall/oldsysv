\S crash: editor crash:  system crash \S

A system crash occurs when a UNIX system unexpectedly malfunctions, and all
processes stop.  This crash causes all users to be logged off the system,
and it causes your terminal to ignore commands you type in.  An editor
crash occurs when an "editor"\S*\S (e.g., ed(1), vi(1), or ex(1))
malfunctions and doesn't respond to editor commands you type.  The UNIX
system tries to save a file you were editing with ed(1) if there is an
editor or system crash.  It does this by saving the contents of the "editor
buffer"\S*\S in a file named "ed.hup" in the directory that you were
working in.  When you log in again, you can replace the file you were
working on with the "ed.hup" file and recover the changes you made.  If you
use vi(1) or ex(1), you can also use these commands with the "r" option to
recover from the crash.
