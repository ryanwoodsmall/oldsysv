\S ` `:  grave accents \S

Grave accents  delimit a command line whose output is returned as a
value.  The output of the command  replaces the accents and the
command line within the accents.  This output can be used as an
"argument"\S*\S for another command or it can be assigned to a 
"shell variable"\S*\S.  For example, if you wanted to do work in
many different directories, but you wanted to remember which
directory you started in, you could begin by doing the following
command substitution:
			ORIGINAL=`pwd`

The pathname of your original directory is then printed when you type 

			echo $ORIGINAL

\S*\S defined in the \Sglossary\S
