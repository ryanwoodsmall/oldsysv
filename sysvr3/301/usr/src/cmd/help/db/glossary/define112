\S word:  half word \S

A word is a unit of storage in a computer.  A word is composed of "bytes"
\S*\S of information.  The number of bytes in a word depends on the computer
you are working on.  The AT&T 3B line of computers, for example, has 4
bytes per word, and 2 bytes per half word.  Words make it convenient to
work with numbers since most regular sized integers are represented as 4
bytes.
