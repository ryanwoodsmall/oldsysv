\S ' ' :  " ":  quote:  quotes:  double quotes \S

Single quotes and double quotes are used to delimit "strings"\S*\S
on command lines.  Single quotes show that the string within them is
a literal string.  For example,

	echo '$HOME'

causes the system to print the literal string 

	$HOME 

Single quotes suspend the meaning of all "special characters"\S*\S
Except for the single quote itself. 

Double quotes show that "shell variables"\S*\S within the  string 
will be replaced by their values.  In the example,

	echo "$HOME is my login directory."

$HOME is replaced by the pathname of your login directory, and the
remainder of the string is printed just as it appears in the quotes.
Double quotes suspend the meaning of all special characters except
for "dollar sign ($)"\S*\S and "grave accent (`)"\S*\S.
