\Sgroup ID: numeric group ID: group ID number \S

A group ID is a name or an integer that is assigned to a number of people
by the system administrator.  A group ID is called a numeric group ID or
group ID number when it is an integer.  People who share a group ID are
members of the same group.  A single group ID is usually assigned to
people who participate in related work.  This gives the group members the
ability to use each other's files according to the group-level "access
permissions"\S*\S for each file.  A group ID may be assigned arbitrarily
if it is not important for an individual to share his work with a group of
people. Each user's group ID is listed in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group
files.
