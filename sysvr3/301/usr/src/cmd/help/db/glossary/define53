\S separator : separator character \S

A separator character is a  character that is used to show the
boundaries between "strings"\S*\S or "fields"\S*\S.   A separator is
"white space"\S*\S or any defined character that serves to separate
adjacent strings. Almost all printing characters that are not
alphanumeric can be used as separators in UNIX systems; however it
is not good practice  to use "special characters"\S*\S because of
their special meaning.
