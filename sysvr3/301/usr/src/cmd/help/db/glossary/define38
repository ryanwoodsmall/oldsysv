\S machine hardware name: machine ID \S

The machine hardware name or machine ID refers to the manufacturer and
model of the computer.  This information is important for identifying
machine-dependent facilities and limitations.  For example,

        DEC PDP-11/70
        DEC VAX-11/780

are machine hardware names.  The UNIX name command, uname(1), with an "m"
"option"\S*\S, i.e., "uname -m", prints the name of the machine that you
are working on.
