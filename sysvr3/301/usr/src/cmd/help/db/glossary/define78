Devices are machines that are used for memory storage, and machines that
are used for input and output to and from the computer.  Magnetic tape and
disks are memory storage devices. They hold the information that you input
into the computer.  A device driver is the machine that runs the magnetic
tape or disk.  Video display terminals and line printers are input and
output devices.
