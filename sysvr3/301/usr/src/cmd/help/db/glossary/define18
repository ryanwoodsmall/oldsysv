\S command:  command line \S

A command is the name of a file that contains an "executable program"\S*\S
or "shell  script"\S*\S.  Commands can be programs or shell scripts that
you created, or they can be standard UNIX system programs.  To execute
the command, you usually type the command name first followed by any
"arguments"\S*\S.  This is called a command line.  For example, the
command line

      pr -t temp


executes the pr(1), or print program for the file "temp" with a particular
form of output specified by the "t" "option"\S*\S.  A command line can be
typed from the terminal or stored in a shell script.
