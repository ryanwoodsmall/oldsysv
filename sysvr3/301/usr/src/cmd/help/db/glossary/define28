\S full pathname : pathname \S

A full pathname or pathname is a way of identifying a file or
directory. A pathname is a sequenced list of the directory names
between the "root directory"\S*\S and the file or directory being
identified. The pathname begins with the root directory, which is 
represented by a slash (/). Directory names and/or a "file name"\S*\S
follows, each separated from the next by a slash (/).  The last name
is the name of the file or directory being identified. For example,
a file called "temp" in a directory called "project", which is owned
by a person with the  login name "sandy" on "system1", has the
following full pathname:
			   /system1/sandy/project/temp

(see also:  relative pathname)
