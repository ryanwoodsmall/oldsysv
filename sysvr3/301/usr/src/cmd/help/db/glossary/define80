\S editor:  text editor:  editor command \S

Editors or text editors are commands that you use to create, change, or add
information to files.  You use editors like other UNIX system commands, by
typing the name of the editor, followed by any options and the name of the
file you want to create or change.  After you type this command line you
will be able to edit the file with editor commands that are specific to the
editor.  Editor commands enable you to move around the file, move or change
text, or to enter new text into the file.
