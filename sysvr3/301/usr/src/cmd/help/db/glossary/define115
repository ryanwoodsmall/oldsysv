\S window:  layer \S

A window is an area within your terminal screen.  The window is set off
from the rest of the screen, and it functions independent of the processes
on the rest of the screen.  If you have two windows on your screen they are
independent of each other and the rest of the screen.

The most common way to create windows on a UNIX system is by using the
layers capability of the TELETYPE 5620 Dot-Mapped Display.  Each window you
create with this program runs a separate shell.  Each one of these shells
is called a layer.

The shl(1) command, which stands for shell layer, offers a function similar
to the layers program for users who do not have a 5620 terminal.  You can
not create windows using shl(1), but you can start different shells which
are independent of each other.  Each of the shells you create with shl(1)
is called a layer.
