\S option:  default-option \S

An option is an "argument"\S*\S that changes the execution of the command.
Options are currently one or more characters, and all options must be 
preceded on the command line by a hyphen (-), plus (+), or an equal sign (=).
In the future, all options will be one character and will be preceded by a 
hyphen (-) only.  On the command line
                                       pr -p temp

the "p" is the option and causes the pr(1) command to pause and beep before
it prints each page of output.  When you do not specify any options, 
the command executes according to its default-options.  For example, 
the file "temp" prints without stopping when you type the command

                                        pr temp
