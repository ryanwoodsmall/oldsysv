\S $:  dollar sign \S  

1)  A dollar sign is used as a "primary prompt"\S*\S in UNIX
systems. It tells the user when the system is ready to accept input
again after executing a command. 

2)  Also, when used preceding a "shell variable"\S*\S, a  dollar
sign ($) causes the value of the shell variable to be substituted 
for its name. For example, 

	echo $HOME

prints the pathname of the user's login directory.
