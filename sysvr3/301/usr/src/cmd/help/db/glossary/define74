\S compiler:  link editor:  loader:  interpreter \S

Before you can execute a program that you write, the UNIX system translates
it so the computer can understand it.  A compiler changes the "high-level 
language"\S*\S instructions in your program, which is the "source code"\S*\S,
into "machine language"\S*\S instructions, which is the "object code"\S*\S.
A link editor, or loader, then combines "object files"\S*\S that are 
necessary to make a complete working program.  The result is an "a.out 
file"\S*\S. Link editing is automatically done when you compile your program 
on UNIX systems. You can link edit without compiling with the ld(1) command.

UNIX system shell is an interpreted language which means that it does not
need to be compiled.  A shell program is translated and executed from the
source code by an interpreter.  The interpreter does not create object code
or an a.out file. It executes each line of the shell program one at a time.
