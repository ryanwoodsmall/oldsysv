\S prompt : prompt string : primary prompt:  secondary prompt \S

A prompt is the character that tells you the shell is ready for you
to type something.  Two types of prompts are used in a  UNIX system:
primary and secondary.  A primary prompt  is the prompt you get
when the system has finished executing a command and it is waiting
for the next command. "Dollar sign ($)"\S*\S is the primary prompt
unless you assign another character to be the prompt character. 
UNIX systems also provide a secondary prompt which is a right arrow
(>).  A secondary prompt is used when the information on a command
line is incomplete.  For example, a secondary prompt is printed when
you do not include  closing quotes on a command line.
