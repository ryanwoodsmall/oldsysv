When you log on to a computer that runs the UNIX system, information is
passed between your terminal and the computer on a "transmission line"\S*\S.
The data transmission line is called line or terminal line.  The place
where the line attaches to the computer is called a port or login port.
Every terminal line and its associated port has an integer that identifies
it.  The integer is called the line number, port number or tty number.  The
system knows each terminal by its tty number. The tty numbers, as well as 
numbers for all the possible devices for your system, are listed in the 
device directory which is called "dev". The tty numbers are named in one of 
two ways:  1) tty followed by an integer; or 2) tty/ followed by an integer.
You can find out your line number by executing the tty(1) command.
