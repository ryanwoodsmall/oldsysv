\S ASCII:  ASCII collating sequence \S

ASCII is an acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
ASCII code uses one "byte"\S*\S of computer memory to represent each
character.  Each alphanumeric and "special character"\S*\S has an ASCII
equivalent.  When files and directories are printed according to the ASCII
code equivalent of the first letter of their names, the order is called
ASCII collating sequence.  The order is special characters first, numbers
second, then upper case and lower case letters.
