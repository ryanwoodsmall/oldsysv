\S network hop \S

Some computers on UNIX systems are organized into networks.  Within a
network, information can be transmitted to any system.  Sometimes the
connection between one system and another is direct and sometimes the
information must be transmitted to an intermediate system before it reaches
its destination.  Every time information is passed from one system to
another, the information makes a network hop.  In the case where an
intermediate system is needed to reach a destination, the information makes
2 network hops.  The uname(1) command lists all of the systems that are
only one network hop from your system.
