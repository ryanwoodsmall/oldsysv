\S relative pathname : . : dot \S

A relative pathname is a sequenced list of the directories between
the current working directory and any other directory or file.  Each
directory in the list, except for the first, is preceded by a slash
(/). When the directory or file is subordinate to the current working 
directory, the names of the directories are listed in the relative  
pathname. If the directory or file of interest is not subordinate, the 
relative pathname indicates this through the use of dot (.) and 
dot dot (..).   Dot (.) represents the name of the current working 
directory, and dot dot (..) represents the name of the "parent 
directory"\S*\S. So, a file named "temp", in the parent directory of 
your current working directory, would have the relative pathname "../temp".
