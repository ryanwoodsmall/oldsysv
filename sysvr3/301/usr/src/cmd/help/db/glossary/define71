\S baud rate:  transmission rate \S

When information is transmitted between the computer and your terminal it
is transmitted at a certain speed.  This speed is called transmission rate
or baud rate and it is measured in "bits"\S*\S per second.  The most
common baud rates are 300 and 1200 bits per second.  If you divide the baud
rate by 10, you get a rough measure of how many characters are transmitted
from the computer to your terminal per second.
