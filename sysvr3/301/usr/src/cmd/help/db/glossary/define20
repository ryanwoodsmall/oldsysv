\S subdirectory :  parent directory \S

A directory is  subordinate to the other directories in  a pathname
if the other directories are closer to the "root directory"\S*\S. 
These subordinate directories are called subdirectories. In
addition, a directory that immediately precedes a subordinate
directory in a pathname is the parent directory of that directory.
In the example,

	/system1/sandy/project


"sandy" and "project" are subordinate to "system1", and "project" is
also subordinate to "sandy". "system1" is the parent directory of
"sandy", and "sandy" is the parent of "project".
