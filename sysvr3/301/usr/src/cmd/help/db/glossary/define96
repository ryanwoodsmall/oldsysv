\S option argument: \S

An option argument is an argument to an option.  The option argument
follows the option on the command line.  It is generally a file or
directory, character or integer.  The relationship between the option-
argument and the option is similar to the relationship between the operand
and the command.  Option-arguments and operands give the option or command
something to work on or work with.  Take for example, the command line

       fgrep [-f temp] new.directory

In this example, the "f" option requires an option argument because it
needs a file to extract strings from.  The file "temp" is the option-
argument. The command fgrep(1) requires an operand that it will search to
find lines that contain strings.  The directory "new.directory" is the
operand.
