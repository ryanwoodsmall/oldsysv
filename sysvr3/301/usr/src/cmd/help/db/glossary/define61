\S system name \S

The system name is a string used to identify a UNIX system. The
names of systems are important for communication between users on
different systems. The system name must be used on the command line
when you send mail(1) to a user who is on another system. Your
system name is printed when you log in, and you can see it again by
executing the UNIX name command, uname(1).
