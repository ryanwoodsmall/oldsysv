\S portable:  portability \S

Portable means that a program or "library"\S*\S can be moved from one
system to another.  Portability is the degree to which a program is moved
easily.  Portability is desirable because once a program is developed it is
used on many systems.  If the program writer must change the program before
it can be distributed to the other systems, time is wasted, and each change
increases the chances for an error.
