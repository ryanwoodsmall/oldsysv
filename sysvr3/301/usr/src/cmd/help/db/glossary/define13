\S argument \S

An argument is a character "string"\S*\S or number that follows a command
on the command line and controls its execution in some way.  There are two
types of arguments:  "options"\S*\S, and "operands"\S*\S.  Options
change the execution or output of the command.  Operands specify files or
directories that will be operated on by the command.  For example, in the
command
        	  pr -p	temp1 temp2

"p", "temp1", and "temp2" are all arguments to the pr(1) command.  The "p"
option causes the program to pause and the terminal to beep at the
beginning of each page of output.  The program waits for you to enter a
carriage return before printing the next page.  The operands "temp1" and
"temp2" specify the files that will be printed.
