\S interrupt \S

To interrupt a program means to stop its execution. You can
interrupt programs you  started by hitting the delete or break key,
or by using the kill(1) command.  You can also  interrupt your
programs by typing a control-d (i.e., hitting the control key and
the letter "d" simultaneously), by turning off the machine, or by
hanging up the data phone,  but these can also cause you to be
logged off of the system. See the "manual page"\S*\S for kill(1)
for a more detailed discussion of interrupt.
