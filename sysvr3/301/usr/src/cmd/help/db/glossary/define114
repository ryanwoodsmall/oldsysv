\S super user \S

Super user is a user who can read and modify any file in the file system.
He or she can also change the "permissions"\S*\S for the files. There
are two ways a user can become the super user.  The first is by logging in
under the login name root.  The second is by using the su(1) command.  Both
of these methods of becoming super user require the user to know the
password for the root login name. Every system needs a super user because
someone must have access to all the files to do maintenance.  This
maintenance is usually the job of the system administrator.
