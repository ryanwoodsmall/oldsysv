\S newline character:  tab character:  blank character:  newline: blank:\S
\Stab \S

In UNIX systems, the contents of a file is stored as a sequence of
characters.  There is a character in the file for every upper case and
lower case letter you type, every number, every punctuation mark, symbol,
and special character.  The UNIX system also stores characters that
represent blanks, tabs, and newlines.  When you are creating a file, or
adding to or modifying a file, and you hit the space bar, the UNIX system
places a blank character in the position in the file where you hit the
space bar.  When you hit the tab key, the UNIX system places a tab
character in that position.  When you type a carriage return, the UNIX
system inserts a newline character.  The newline character is an
instruction that means this line is finished, move to the next line and
continue. When you print your file, all of the blanks, tabs, and newlines
are there, but you do not see the characters that produced them.  These
characters are called "non-printing characters"\S*\S because they exist but are
not printed when you print your file.

When you want to create blanks, tabs, and newlines in the output of shell
programs, you use \b, \t, and \n, respectively.
(see also:  backslash.)
