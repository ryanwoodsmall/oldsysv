\S high-level language:  machine language:  interpreted language \S

High-level languages are languages like C, FORTRAN, COBOL, and PASCAL that
allow you to create programs with English-like statements.  High-level language
programs are easy for people to read but the computer cannot understand 
the statements.  Machine language can be understood by the computer, and 
in UNIX systems machine language is "octal code"\S*\S.  You create machine 
language using a "compiler"\S*\S" to compile a high-level language program.

Interpreted languages are languages that do not have to be compiled before
the computer can understand them. Interpreted languages are high-level
languages because they have English-like statements but they do not have to
be translated to machine language.  An "interpreter"\S*\S executes each line 
of the program one at a time.  Shell is the UNIX system interpreted language.
