\S positional parameters \S

Positional parameters are "variables"\S*\S whose values are the arguments
to a shell program.  When you type a command line to execute a shell
program, you type the name of the file the program is in followed by any
arguments the program needs to execute.  Each of the components of the
command line are assigned to a positional parameter depending on the
position they are in on the command line. The name of the file that holds
the shell program is positional parameter "0", the first "argument"\S*\S
is positional parameter 1, and so on until all of the arguments are
assigned to a positional parameter or until all nine positional parameters
have been assigned values.  The values of the positional parameters are
passed to the program when the command is executed.
