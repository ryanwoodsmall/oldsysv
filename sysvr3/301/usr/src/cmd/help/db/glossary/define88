\S library \S

A library is an "archive file"\S*\S that contains "object"\S*\S code
for programs that perform common tasks.  The programs are programs that are
used frequently.  Some libraries contain object code for mathematical
functions, and others contain code for input and output functions.  The
library provides a common source for object code and saves space by
providing one copy of a program instead of requiring every program that
wants to incorporate the function of the program to have its own copy.
