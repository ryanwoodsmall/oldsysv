\S -:  minus:  dash:  hyphen \S

  1.  A minus or dash "-" precedes the options on the command lines for
      most UNIX system commands.  The minus is a flag that signals the
      command that the character, or characters that follow are options.
      This ensures that the "option"\S*\S is not interpreted as an
      "operand"\S*\S.  Some commands do not follow this rule.  Their
      options may be preceded by "+" or they might not have any flag.

  2.  A minus can also be used on some command lines to mean "standard
      input"\S*\S.  If you substitute "-" for the operand, the command
      will use standard input.
