\S \:  backslash \S

1)  A backslash suspends the meaning of a "special character"\S*\S. 
When a special character is preceded by a backslash the character no
longer has a special meaning; therefore it will be treated the same
as an  alphanumeric character.  For example, the command

	rm temp\*

removes only the file named  "temp*".  If the special meaning of
"asterisk (*)"\S*\S were not suspended, the command would also
remove "temp", "temp1", "tempsave", and all other files whose names
begin with "temp".

2)  A backslash also gives special meaning to some alphanumeric
characters that are used in "shell programs"\S*\S:

	\n is a newline, i.e., a carriage return and a linefeed
	\t is a tab
	\b is a backspace
	\r is a carriage return without a linefeed
	\c inhibits a carriage return
