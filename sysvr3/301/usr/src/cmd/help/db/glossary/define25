Files are storage areas.  The type of information stored in a file
depends on the type of file that it is.  The list command, ls(1), 
with an  "l" "option"\S*\S,  i.e., "ls -l", identifies
the types of files using  these characters:

	b block special  
	c character special  
	d directory  
	p named pipe 
	- ordinary  

Most of your files are ordinary files and directories.  Ordinary
files store text, data, programs, and other coded information.  

Directories store files and other directories. "Block"\S*\S and
character special files are used by the system to control input and
output devices.  Ordinary users will rarely, if ever, have to use
these two types of files.   Named "pipes"\S*\S are files containing
programs that take the output of one command and use it as the input
for another command.
