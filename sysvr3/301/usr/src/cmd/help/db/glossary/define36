\S login : login name : login directory : password \S

To login  means to connect your terminal to the computer and  become
a user of a UNIX system.  You begin the login process by  typing
your login name.   You choose your login name when you first become
a user of the system, and you must select a login name that is 
different from the other users on your system.  After you type your
login name, the system asks you for your password.  Your password is
a "string"\S*\S that verifies your identity as the "owner"\S*\S of your 
login name.  Your password is to remain secret.  To make your password 
hard to guess you should make it seven or eight characters long, 
include at least one number or "special character"\S*\S, and change  
your password every six months. Your login name is usually used to 
name the directory that you enter once you are logged in. This is
called your login directory. 

Your login name also identifies you as the owner of certain files
and directories in your system.  This means that you have control of
the "access permissions"\S*\S for the files you own, and the
permissions for the owner are the ones that apply to you.
