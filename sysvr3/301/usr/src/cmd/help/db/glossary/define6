\S & :  ampersand:  background \S

An ampersand following a command causes the command to be executed
in the background.  When a program is executed in the background it
is executed in a way that permits you to continue  working on the
terminal while the command is executing.  The output of the command
is returned to your terminal as soon as it has finished executing.
Unless you redirect the output (see "redirection"\S*\S) to another
terminal or a file, it will be interspersed with whatever else is on
the screen at the time.
