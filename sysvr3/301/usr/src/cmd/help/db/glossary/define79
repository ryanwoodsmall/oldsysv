\S directory name:  simple directory name \S

A directory name is a "string"\S*\S of characters that identifies a
directory.  A directory name can be a simple directory name which is the
name of a "subdirectory"\S*\S in your current working directory.  Simple
directory names can not be more than 14 characters long and can not contain
"pipe"\S*\S characters. A directory name can also be the relative pathname 
or full pathname of a directory.  Directories with the same name can
exist in different directories, but subdirectory names within the same
directory must be unique.
