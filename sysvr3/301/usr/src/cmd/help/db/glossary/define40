\S manual page:  section number \S

A manual page is a page or pages from the UNIX System User's, Programmer's,
or Administrator's Reference Manual that describes a command and lists its
"arguments"\S*\S.  These manuals are divided into sections.  Each section
has a section number and the numbering is continuous from one manual to the
next.  Commands are commonly referred to by name and section number.  For
example, profile(2) refers to the manual page for profile in section 2 of
the manual.  If no section number is listed, you should assume section 1.
