\S file system : file system structure :  current working directory: \S 
\S directory \S

The file system used in UNIX systems is a hierarchical collection
of directories and other files that are organized in a tree structure.
The base of the structure is the "root directory"\S*\S and it is  
represented by a slash (/) at the beginning of every "full pathname"\S*\S.  
Other directories, all of which are subordinate to root, are branches. 
Many directories and "subdirectories"\S*\S can exist between root and a file.
Ordinary files are the  storage areas in the file system, and can be thought
of as  leaves of the tree. The current working directory is one of the 
branches between root and your ordinary  files, and it is the directory that 
you are working in at any particular time.  Unless you state otherwise, new
files or directories that you create are attached to the branch which is your 
current working directory.
