\S angle brackets:  arrow \S

  1.  Angle brackets (< >), mark variable names in the UNIX system help
    facility.  These are variable names from the syntax summaries that 
    are used in the description of the command.  Variable names represent 
    the option arguments and operands in the syntax summary.  
    When you type a command line, you don't type
    the variable name, you substitute a value for the variable name.
    Angle brackets inform you that what you are reading is a variable
    that you substitute a value for.

  2.  A left arrow, <, is used on a command line to redirect standard input
    from a file to a command.  A right arrow, >, redirects the standard
    output or standard error output from a command to a file.
    (see:  redirection)
