\S *: asterisk \S

In the shell, an asterisk matches any "string"\S*\S of characters in
a "file name"\S*\S on a command line. The command

	        rm temp*

removes all files from the current working directory that begin with
the string "temp".  Files like "temp", "temp1", and "temp.save"
would all be deleted.  An asterisk alone matches any file name in the
current working directory except  those beginning with "dot (.)"\S*\S.
For example,
         	rm *

removes all the files in your directory except for the dot (.)files.
