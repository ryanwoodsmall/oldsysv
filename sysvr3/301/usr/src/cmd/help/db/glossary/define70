\S  archive:  archive file:  header:  symbol table:  file format \S

An archive or archive file is a file that contains the contents of many
files.  Each of the files within an archive is called a member.  You can
archive files to organize files that have related contents.  You can also
archive files of "object code"\S*\S to create a "library"\S*\S and save computer
memory space.  When you create a file whose members contain object code, the 
command you use creates a symbol table. The symbol table is a file at the 
beginning of the archive.  The symbol table holds information on the 
variables in each member of the archive.  You cannot access the file that 
contains the symbol table.  When you create an archive, the command also 
creates a header at the beginning of each member.  The header has information
about the size, name, permissions, and date and time of last modification 
of the file. This information marks where one member ends and another 
member begins.  You can create an archive using ar(1), tar(1), or cpio(1).
