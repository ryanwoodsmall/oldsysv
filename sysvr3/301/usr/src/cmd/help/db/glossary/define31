\S HOME:  $HOME:  HOME directory \S

When you log on to a UNIX system, a program assigns the pathname of your
login directory to the "shell variable"\S*\S HOME.  For this reason, your
login directory is also called your HOME directory.  HOME is a "shell"\S*\S
variable that makes working with the pathname of your login directory
easier by reducing the amount of typing that you have to do.  If you
include $HOME in a pathname, the pathname for your login directory will
be substituted for it.  HOME also makes it possible for different users to
use a "program"\S*\S that refers to the user's login directory without
editing the program to change every instance of the pathname.
