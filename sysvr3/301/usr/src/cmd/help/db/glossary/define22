\S erase character \S

An erase character deletes the  character immediately before it on
the current command line.  The erase character is usually the 
"pound sign(#)"\S*\S.  Typing several erase characters deletes the
same number of characters, beginning with the most recently typed 
character and working backwards.  For example,  the result of typing

	cp temp1 temp2#####temp4
is 
	cp temp1 temp4 

because the five pound signs (#) deleted the five characters that preceded
them. The erase character can be changed by using the  set teletype command,
stty(1).  BACKSPACE is often used as the erase character on video terminals.
