\S process :  process number :  active process \S

A process is the unit of computation for a UNIX system. Every time
you type a name of a file that contains an executable program  (see
"mode"\S*\S) you initiate a new process. Shell programs can cause 
the initiation of many processes because they can contain many
command lines.  An active process is a program that is being
executed or is  waiting to be executed.  A process is active until
its completion is recorded by the computer on an internal table.
A process number is an integer value that is assigned to an active
process.  The process status command, ps(1), will print the
process numbers of all the processes that belong to you. You
can use the kill(1) command to stop a process that is currently 
active.
