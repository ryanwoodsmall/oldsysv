\S loop:  infinite loop \S

A loop is a way to repeat a sequence of statements in a computer program.
Most computer languages provide ways to create loops. Usually there is a
test at the beginning, or top, of the loop.  As long as the result of the
test is true, the sequence of statements in the loop is repeated. If the
test is always true, then the loop will repeat forever.  This is called an
infinite loop.
