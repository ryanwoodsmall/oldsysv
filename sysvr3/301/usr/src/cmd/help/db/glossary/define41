\S non-printing character \S

Non-printing characters are characters that do not print on your terminal
the way that they exist in your file.  There are two types of non-printing
characters:  1) those that an editor inserts into a file; and 2) those that
you insert into a file.

The first kind occur when you edit a file and you type a space, tab, or
carriage return.  The editor puts a character in to represent that
keystroke.  When you print the file, you see a space, tab, or your file
starts printing on a new line.  You do not see the character the editor
uses.

The second type of non-printing characters are those that you use in a
shell program.  You can ring the bell on your terminal by inserting a \07
in a shell program or file.  The \07 never prints.
