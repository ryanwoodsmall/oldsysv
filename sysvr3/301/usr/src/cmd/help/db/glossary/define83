\S EOF:  end-of-file:  end-of-file character \S

EOF stands for end-of-file and refers to the point at which a file ends.
UNIX systems recognize the end of a file because it knows how many
"bytes"\S*\S are in the file and it knows when a command has seen them
all.  But, when you are giving a command input from the terminal key board,
the system does not know how much input you will type before you are
finished. To mark the end of a file and terminate your input, you type an
end of file character.  Control-d is the end of file character used to
signal the end of file and you type it by depressing the control key and
striking the letter "d" simultaneously.
