\S #:  pound sign \S

1)  A pound sign is the "erase character"\S*\S  for your terminal,
unless you specify a different character.  Each pound sign erases
one character that precedes it on the current  line.

2) When it is used in a "shell script"\S*\S, a pound sign marks a
comment. The pound sign causes the shell to ignore everything that
follows until the end of the line, where a newline character signals
the end of the comment.
