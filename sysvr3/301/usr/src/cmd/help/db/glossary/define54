\S shell: shell level:  shell command level \S

The shell is a program that handles all communication between you and a
UNIX system. The shell interprets command lines, causes the appropriate
programs to be executed, and provides the "environment"\S*\S at your
terminal. As part of the environment, the shell provides a prompt when it
is waiting for input from you.  When you execute UNIX system commands in
response to prompts from the shell, you are at shell level or at shell
command level.
