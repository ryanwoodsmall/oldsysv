\Spasswd\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  passwd [login_name]

         where:  login_name  is a login name.

Description:
     Use \Spasswd\S to change the "password" that is associated with your
     login name.  \Spasswd\S prompts you for your old password and then for
     the new password. Your new password is accepted if the following
     conditions are satisfied: 1)  your new password has six or more
     characters, at least two alphabetic and one numeric or special character;
     2)  your new password differs from your old password by three or more
     characters; and 3) your new password does not resemble any reverse or
     circular shift of your login name.  Some UNIX systems also require that
     you use a password for a certain amount of time before you can change it.
