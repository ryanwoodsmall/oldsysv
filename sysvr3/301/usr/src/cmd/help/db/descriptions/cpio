\Scpio\S :  Description

Syntax Summary:  cpio -i [BSbcdfmrstuv] [pattern ...]
                 cpio -o [Bacv]
                 cpio -p [adlmuv] dir_name

         where:  pattern  is the name of a file or regular expression.

                 dir_name  is the name of a directory.

Description:
    \Scpio\S stands for "copy in and out."  \Scpio\S archives and unarchives
     files and directories.  Archiving files saves inodes and space in memory.
     Use \Scpio\S to archive files so you can transfer them to other UNIX
     systems.  You can also use \Scpio\S to move an entire directory hierarchy
     to another directory or file system.  With the "o" option, \Scpio\S takes
     file names from standard input and archives them, and sends them to
     standard output as a single file. Use \Scpio\S with the "i" option to
     unarchive a file that you archived with "\Scpio\S -o".  "\Scpio\S -i"
     returns each file in the archive back to its original form.  You can
     archive an entire directory when you have only read permission, but you
     must have write permission to unarchive the archive file.  \Scpio\S with
     the "p" option takes files from standard input and archives them.  It then
     copies them to a directory where it unarchives them.  "\Scpio\S -p"
     passes the files to the new directory without creating a permanent 
     archive.  See also: tar(1) for a command with a function similar to
     \Scpio\S, and find(1), and ls(1) for commands that might be used with
     \Scpio\S.
