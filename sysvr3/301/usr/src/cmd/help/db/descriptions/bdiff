\Sbdiff\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  bdiff file_name1 file_name2 [lines] [-s]

         where:  file_names  are names of files.

                 lines is an integer.

Description:
     \Sbdiff\Sstands for "big difference."  \Sbdiff\S compares the contents
     of two files.  Use \Sbdiff\S to compare two files that are too big for
     diff(1).  \Sbdiff\S divides big files into segments of 3500 lines per
     segment and compares the segments from the two files using diff(1).  You
     can change the number of <lines> per segment by specifying an integer on
     the command line. \Sbdiff\S lists the type of changes that are necessary
     to make the files identical. See also: cmp(1), comm(1), diff(1), diff3(1),
     dircmp(1), and sdiff(1) for commands with functions similar to \Sbdiff\S.
