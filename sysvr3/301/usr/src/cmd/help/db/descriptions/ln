\Sln\S:  Description

Syntax Summary: ln [-f] original_file new_file
                ln [-f] original_file ... new_dir

         where:  original_file and new_file  are names of files.

                 new_dir  is a directory.

Description:
     \Sln\S stands for "link." Use \Sln\S to give a file more than one name.
     \Sln\S "links" the new name to a file so that you can reference the
     <original_file> using either the original or new file name.  You can link
     a new name to a file, or you can link a new directory to many file names.
     When you link a new directory to many file names, the files maintain the
     same names and are members of the new directory as well as the original
     directory.  If the access permissions of the <new_file> or <new_dir> 
     forbid writing, \Sln\S will ask you if you want to link the file names
     anyway.  If you respond "y" for "yes," \Sln\S will make a link between the
     <new_file> or <new_dir> and the <original_file>.  You must be careful of
     three things with \Sln\S:  First, you will have the same permissions on
     the <new_file> as you did on the <original_file>. Second, if you edit a
     file using one of the file names, the contents of all of the file names
     that are linked to it change:  remember, there's really only one file.
     Third, \Sln\S won't work unless all of the file names reside on the same
     file system.  See also:  cp(1) and mv(1) for commands with functions
     similar to \Sln\S.
