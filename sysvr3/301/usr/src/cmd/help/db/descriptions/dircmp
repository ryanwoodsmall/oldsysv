\Sdircmp\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      dircmp [-ds] [-width] dir_name1 dir_name2

         where:  dir_names  are names of directories.

                 width  is an integer.

Description:
     \Sdircmp\S stands for "directory comparison." \Sdircmp\S compares the
     contents of directories.  Use \Sdircmp\S to compare the names of the
     files in the directories, and then compare the contents of the files that
     have the same names.  \Sdircmp\S lists the file names that are in only
     one directory on the first page of output.  The file names that are in 
     both directories but have different contents all listed on the second
     page.  And \Sdircmp\S lists the file names that are the same and have
     identical contents on the third page.  \Sdircmp\S always lists the file
     names that are in only one directory, but you can suppress the listing of
     identical files.  With the correct options, \Sdircmp\S creates a script
     that makes two files with the same name into identical files, or changes
     the width of the output lines.  See also:  bdiff(1), cmp(1), comm(1),
     diff(1), diff3(1), sdiff(1) for commands with functions similar to
     \Sdircmp\S.
