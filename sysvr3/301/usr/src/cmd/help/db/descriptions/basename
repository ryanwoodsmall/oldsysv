\Sbasename\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  basename name [suffix]

         where:  name  is a file or directory name.

                 suffix  is a sequence of alphanumeric or special characters.
Description:
     \Sbasename\S identifies the last name in a relative path name or full
     path name and prints it on standard output.  Use \Sbasename\S in a shell
     program to identify the last file name or directory name in a path name.
     If <name> is a path name, \Sbasename\S prints the final directory or file
     name.  If <name> is a simple file name or a directory name, \Sbasename\S
     prints that file or directory name on standard output.  You can remove a
     string that is a suffix at the end of a file name by including it as an
     argument. See also:  dirname(1) for a command with a function similar to
     \Sbasename\S.
