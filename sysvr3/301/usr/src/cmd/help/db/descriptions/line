\Sline\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  line

Description:
     \Sline\S copies a line of text from standard input.  The text is sent to
     standard output unless you assign it to a variable.  Use \Sline\S in
     shell programs to read information from the terminal or a file and store
     the text for later use.  \Sline\S copies text from the beginning until
     the end of a line.  The end of a line is marked by a new line character.
     When \Sline\S reaches the end of a file or reads an end-of-file
     character, it sets the exit status to 1.
