Syntax Summary:  at time [future] [date]
                 at -l [job ...]
                 at -r job ...

         where:  time  is the time on a 12 or 24 hour clock,
                       or "noon", "midnight", "now", or "next".

                 future  is an integer that indicates a duration of time
                         and a measure of time stated as "minutes,"
                         "hours," "days," "weeks," "months," or "years."

                 job  is a job number.

Description:
     \Sat\S executes commands at a time in the future.  Use \Sat\S to read
     commands from standard input and execute them at the date and time you
     specify on the \Sat\S command line.  <time> is specified as 1:00 p.m.,
     13:00, or in words like noon or midnight. <future> specifies an amount of
     time and unit of time that \Sat\S should wait to execute the commands.
     <date> is assumed to be the current date unless another date is specified,
     or unless <time> has already passed for today.  \Sat\S assigns a job
     number to the commands and it prints the job number and the date and time
     that it will execute the job.  You receive the output of the commands
     through mail(1) unless you redirect it.  \Sat\S can also remove a
     previously scheduled job, or list the job numbers and times for jobs that
     you scheduled using \Sat\S or batch(1). You cannot use \Sat\S unless
     your login name appears in the file /usr/lib/cron/at.allow. If your 
     system does not have an "at.allow" file, then your login name must 
     not appear in the file /usr/lib/cron/at.deny.  Details for using \Sat\S
     are available on the manual page.  See also:  batch(1) and kill(1) 
     for commands with functions similar to \Sat\S, and nice(1) and ps(1) 
     for commands that might be used with \Sat\S.
