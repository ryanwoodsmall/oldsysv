Description:
     \Sfind\S is used to locate files.  It begins searching at the directory
     or file that you list on the command line.  Which files it locates, and
     the action it takes when it finds them, are both determined by the logical
     expression.  \Sfind\S can print the path name of a file, check for files
     of certain size or check for files that belong to a certain user.  Check
     the examples given here, and see the manual page for \Sfind\S for
     information on creating logical expressions.
