\Ssum\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  sum [-r] file_name ...

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Ssum\S reports the checksum and the number of 512 byte blocks of storage
     that the file occupies.  The checksum is the sum of the octal values of
     the characters in the file.  Use \Ssum\S to verify that two copies of a 
     file are the same.  You execute \Ssum\S on a file both before and 
     after it is archived and transmitted to another system to "check the sum"
     for the transmitted file to check that the file was transmitted without 
     any errors.  See also: size(1) and wc(1) for a command with a function 
     similar to \Ssum\S.
