         where:  setting  is a string that specifies a terminal
                          characteristic.

Description:

     value of UNIX environment variables that affect your terminal, and to
     report the current status of those variables.  Typing \Sstty\S by itself
     prints a summary of the current status of your terminal's settings.
     \Sstty\S with settings as an argument resets that terminal characteristic
     for your terminal.  For more information on setting terminal 
     characteristics using environment variables see the manual page for
