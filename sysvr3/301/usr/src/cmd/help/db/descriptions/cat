Syntax Summary:  cat [-su] [ -v [-et] ] [file_name ...]

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
    \Scat\S is  shorthand  for "concatenate".  Use \Scat\S to send the
    contents of a file to standard output.  If more than one file name is used,
    \Scat\S prints each file in sequence on the standard output.  \Scat\S
    echos standard input if you do not list a file name or if you use "-" as an
    argument. See also:  cp(1), pg(1) and pr(1) for commands with functions
    similar to \Scat\S.
