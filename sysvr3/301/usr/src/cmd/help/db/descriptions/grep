\Sgrep\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      grep [-b][-c][-i][-l][-n][-s][-v] limited_expr [name ...]

         where:  limited_expr  is a limited regular expression.

                 name  is the name of a file or directory.

Description:
     \Sgrep\S searches a file for a pattern and prints all lines that contain
     the pattern. \Sgrep\S patterns are limited regular expressions like those
     used with ed(1).  If you do not specify a <name>, \Sgrep\S uses standard
     input.  With options, you can get a count of lines containing the pattern,
     the names of files containing found lines, and line and block numbers
     associated with the found line.  For more information about regular 
     expressions see the manual page for ed(1).  
     See also: egrep(1), and fgrep(1) for commands with functions similar 
     to grep, and csplit(1) and cut(1) for commands that might be used 
     with \Sgrep\S.
