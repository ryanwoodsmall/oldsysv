\Scmp\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  cmp [-l] [-s] file_name1 file_name2

         where:  file_names  are names of files.

Description:
     \Scmp\S is short for "compare." The primary use of \Scmp\S is to compare
     two files that contain characters that are represented in octal.
     Executable files contain characters that are represented in octal, but
     \Scmp\S can also compare text files where the characters are represented
     as ASCII characters.  Without any options, \Scmp\S reports the line number
     and the number of the byte where the first difference between the files
     occurs.  \Scmp\S can also list all the differences between the files, or
     just changes the exit status to show that the files are different. 


     If you replace <file_name1> with "-", \Scmp\S will accept standard input.
     See also: bdiff(1), comm(1), diff(1), diff3(1), dircmp(1), and sdiff(1)
     for commands with functions similar to \Scmp\S.
