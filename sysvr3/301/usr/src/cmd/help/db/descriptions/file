\Sfile\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      file [-c] [-f list_file] [-m type_file] file_name ...

         where:  list_file, file_name, and type_file  are simple file names.

Description:
     \Sfile\S reports the file type of files that you list as arguments.  Use
     it to find out if files are directories, ordinary files, character special
     files, block special files, or named pipes.  If a file is filled with 
     ASCII characters, \Sfile\S will try to guess the computer language it is 
     written in.  If the file is executable, it will print the name of the 
     machine that the file was created for.  \Sfile\S will also tell you if a 
     file is a cpio(1) or ar(1) archive.  Instead of listing files on the 
     command line, you can use the "f" option with a <list_file> that contains
     file names for \Sfile\S to check. 

     See the glossary(1) for a list of file types.  See also:  ls(1) for a 
     command with a function similar to \Sfile\S.
