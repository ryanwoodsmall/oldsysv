\Sred\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  red [-] [-x] [-p string] [file_name]

         where:  string  is a sequence of characters delimited
                         by white space and/or double quotes.

                 file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Sred\S is a "restricted" version of the line "editor" ed(1).  As with
     ed(1), you use \Sred\S to change the contents of files. When you type
     \Sred\S you invoke the editor, which makes a copy of the file you want to
     edit and puts the copy into a buffer.  Everything you type after you 
     invoke the editor is interpreted as a command to move around in the 
     file or change the text in the buffer.  A typical command for \Sred\S 
     might include a line number or regular expression identifying the lines 
     to be changed, a single character for the type of change to be made, 
     and parameters to the command such as the text that should be 
     substituted.  \Sred\S is different from ed(1) because editing is 
     restricted to files in the current working directory, and \Sred\S does 
     not permit escapes to the shell via "! command".  See the manual 
     pages for ed(1) and the ed(1) tutorial in the "UNIX System User's Guide" 
     for instructions on editing with \Sred\S.
