\Sdiff\S: Description

Syntax Summary:
      diff [-b] [-e] [-f] [-h] file_name1 file_name2

         where:  file_names  are names of files.

Description:
     \Sdiff\S stands for "differential file comparator."  Use \Sdiff\S to
     compare the contents of two text files.  \Sdiff\S lists the lines that
     are different and lines that must be changed to make the files identical.
     \Sdiff\S marks the lines that are only in <file_name1> with a "<", and
     those in <file_name2> with a ">".  The output also includes lines that
     resemble ed(1) commands that show the changes you must make to convert
     <file_name1> to <file_name2>.  \Sdiff\S can take a directory as an
     argument if the directory contains a file with the same name as the file
     that you list as the second argument.  \Sdiff\S will compare the two
     files with the same name. \Sdiff\S can compare standard input to a file
     if one argument is "-" and the other is the name of a file.  See also:
     bdiff(1), cmp(1), comm(1), diff3(1), and sdiff(1) for commands with
     functions similar to \Sdiff\S, and ed(1) for a command that might be used
     with \Sdiff\S.
