\Snice\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  nice [-increment] command

         where:  increment  is an integer from 1 to 19
                            that changes the level of priority.

                 command  is a UNIX system command, a shell program,
                          or an executable file and any arguments
                          it might take.

Description:
     \Snice\S executes a command with a lower CPU priority than normal.  This
     allows the system to execute other commands first.  The <increment>     
     changes the level of priority; the higher the increment, the lower the
     priority.  If you don't give an increment, 10 is used.  You should execute
     \Snice\S in the background using an "&" so that you can work while
     \Snice\S in the background to execute the command. Otherwise, you will 
     not be able to execute any other commands until \Snice\S is finished.
     See also:  nohup(1) for information on a command that might be used with
     \Snice\S.
