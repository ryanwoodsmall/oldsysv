\Sls\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  ls [-CFRabcdfgilmnopqrstux] [name ...]

         where:  name  is a file or directory name.

Description:
     \Sls\S stands for "list."  Use \Sls\S to list the names of files and
     subdirectories in a directory.  Without arguments, \Sls\S lists the files
     in the current working directory.  When you use a file name as an argument
     to \Sls\S, it prints the name of that file.  \Sls\S accepts multiple
     arguments, and they can be a mixture of directory names and file names.
     The output is listed in alphabetical order by default.  The options to 
     \Sls\S change the kind of information that is printed and the order in
     which the information is printed.  See also:  echo(1) for a command with
     a function similar to \Sls\S.
