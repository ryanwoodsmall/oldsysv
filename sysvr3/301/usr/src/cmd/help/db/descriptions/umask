\Sumask\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  umask [octal_code]

         where:  octal_code  is a three digit code, each digit
                             between zero and seven, inclusive.

Description:
     \Sumask\S stands for "user file-creation mode mask." Use \Sumask\S to
     change the mode, or access permissions, for the files you create. The
     contents of the files are not effected by \Sumask\S.  To use \Sumask\S
     you must include it in your .profile file.  \Sumask\S sets the mode of a
     file by subtracting the value of the octal code for \Sumask\S from the
     octal code that defines access permissions.  Your system, for example,
     might set access permissions to 666, which gives read and write permission
     to you the owner, your group, and the other system users. The code removes
     either read permission, write permission, or both for all or one of the
     types of users.  Without arguments, \Sumask\S prints the value of your
     octal code.  For a discussion of the octal codes see the manual pages for
     chmod(1). See glossary(1) for an explanation of access permissions.  See
     also: chmod(1) for a command with a function similar to \Sumask\S.
