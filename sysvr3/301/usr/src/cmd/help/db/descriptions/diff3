\Sdiff3\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      diff3 [-3] [-e] [-x] [-3] file_name1 file_name2 file_name3

         where:  file_names  are names of files.

Description:
     \Sdiff3\S stands for "differential 3 way" file comparison.  \Sdiff3\S
     compares the contents of three files.  Use \Sdiff3\S when you want to
     identify how three files are different.  \Sdiff3\S lists the type of
     changes necessary to make 3 files identical under one of four headings.
     When <file_name1> is different \Sdiff3\S lists the changes under the
     heading "====1". When <file_name2> or <file_name3> is different, \Sdiff3\S
     lists the changes under the headings "====2", or "====3".  \Sdiff3\S
     lists the changes under the heading "====" when all three files are
     different.  \Sdiff3\S can create scripts that ed(1) uses to incorporate
     differences between the files into <file_name1>.  
     See also:  bdiff(1), comm(1), cmp(1), diff(1), dircmp(1), and sdiff(1)
     for commands with functions similar to \Sdiff3\S.
