Description:
     \Sps\S stands for "process status".  Use \Sps\S to print information
     about active UNIX system processes.  If you type \Sps\S by itself it
     prints a list of basic information about all the processes associated with
     your terminal.  It prints the process ID number, the tty number of the
     controlling terminal, the time the command was executed and the command
     name.  With different options, \Sps\S prints information about processes
     belonging to other users or groups of users and additional information
     about the processes.  See also:  kill(1) and nice(1) for commands that
     might be used with \Sps\S.
