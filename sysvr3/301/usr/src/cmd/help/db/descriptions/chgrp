Description:
     \Schgrp\S stands for "change group." Use \Schgrp\S to change the group
     of users who have access to files or directories. You name a new group
     using a numeric group ID from the /etc/passwd file or a group name from
     the /etc/group file.  \Schgrp\S does not change the contents of the 
     files and directories.  It only changes the people who have read, 
     write, and execute permission.  You must own the files or directories 
     or be the super-user to use \Schgrp\S.  See the glossary(1) for a 
     discussion of access permissions and group.  See also: chmod(1) and 
     chown(1) for commands with functions similar to \Schgrp\S.
