\Segrep\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      egrep [-b][-c][-i][-l][-n][-v] [-e special_expr] [-f file_name]
            [full_expr] [name ...]

         where:  special_expr and full_expr  are full regular expressions.

                 name  is the name of a file or directory.

Description:
     \Segrep\S searches files for all the lines that contain a pattern of
     characters.  \Segrep\S uses full regular expressions to match the
     patterns then prints the line that contains the pattern to standard 
     output.  If you don't specify a file, \Segrep\S uses standard input.
     With options \Segrep\S prints a count of lines that contain the 
     pattern specified by <full_expr>, the names of files that contain the 
     pattern, and line and block numbers associated with the found line.
     \Segrep\S is different from grep(1) and fgrep(1) because you use 
     full regular expressions to identify patterns and you can use "+", "?",
     "|", "()" in the expressions.  For information about regular expressions 
     see the glossary(1) and read the manual pages for ed(1).  See also: 
     grep(1) and fgrep(1) for command with functions similar to \Segrep\S.
