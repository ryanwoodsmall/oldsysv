Description:
     \Smail\S refers to electronic mail.  Use \Smail\S to communicate with
     other users on your system and other systems.  You may send mail to one or
     more persons on your own computer system by listing one or more login
     names.  You can send mail to users on remote systems by specifying the
     system they work on and their login name separated from one another by a
     "!".  You can send messages from standard input or from a file.  When you
     type \Smail\S, it prints all of the messages other users sent to you in
     last-in, first-out order. The options change the order in which your
     messages are printed, or change the procedure you use to save each 
     message.  \Smail\S also enables you to forward mail to one or more other
     users.  See manual page for instructions on sending, saving, or deleting 
     mail messages.  See also:  mailx(1), mesg(1), write(1), and rmail(1) for
