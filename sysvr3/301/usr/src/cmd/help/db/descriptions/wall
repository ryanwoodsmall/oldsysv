\Swall\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  wall

Description:
     \Swall\S stands for "write all".  Use \Swall\S to send messages to all
     system users.  \Swall\S reads the standard input and sends it as a
     message to all current system users.  The typical use of \Swall\S is to
     warn users that the system is being brought down. The sender of the
     message must be super-user, otherwise, users who have turned off the write
     access to their terminal will not receive the message.  See also: write(1)
     for a command with a function similar to \Swall\S.
