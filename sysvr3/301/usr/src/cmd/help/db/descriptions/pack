\Spack\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  pack [-] [-f] file_name ...

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Spack\S creates a compressed versions of files.  Use \Spack\S to recode
     files so that they are smaller and take up less storage space. \Spack\S
     can reduce the size of a file by between 10 and 40 percent. \Spack\S is
     most effective when you use it on text files that are larger than three
     blocks. \Spack\S removes the original files and renames the files by adding
     ".z" suffix to the original file names.  \Spack\S lists the size of the
     new files, and the names of the files that did not pack.  Use pcat(1) 
     and unpack(1) to return the files to their original form.  The manual 
     page for \Spack\S lists the reasons why a file might not pack.  See also:
     pcat(1), tar(1), and unpack(1) for commands that might be used with \Spack\S.
