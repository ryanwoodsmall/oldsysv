\Sbatch\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:   batch

Description:
     Use \Sbatch\S to delay the execution of commands until the system does
     not have a heavy work load.  \Sbatch\S reads commands from standard
     input.  \Sbatch\S treats them as a single job, and a single job number is
     assigned to all of them.  When the system load permits, \Sbatch\S
     executes the job. The output of all the commands in the job is sent to you
     through mail(1), unless you redirect it.  If you decide that you do not
     want to execute the job, you can remove it using the at(1) command.  See
     also:  at(1) and ps(1) for commands that might be used with \Sbatch\S.
