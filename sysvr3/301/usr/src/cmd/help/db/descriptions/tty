\Stty\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  tty [-l] [-s]

Description:
     \Stty\S tells you the terminal line number of the login port you are
     currently using.  Systems vary slightly in what they name the terminal
     lines.  For example, one terminal line number might be "08" and on another
     system it would be "tty08".  For the former, the output of \Stty\S  
     would be "/dev/tty/08", and for the latter it would be "/dev/tty08".
