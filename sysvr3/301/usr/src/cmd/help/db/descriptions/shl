\Sshl\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  shl

Description:
     \Sshl\S stands for "shell layer" manager.  Use \S shl \S to create new
     shells that run simultaneously without interacting with each other.  This
     allows you to do work within many shells at one time without changing
     terminals and without worrying that the work you're doing in one shell 
     will affect the processes that are going on in another shell.  This 
     command is similar to and cannot be used with the layers program that 
     is available on the Teletype* 5620 Dot-Mapped Display terminal.  
     (See the 5620 Dot-Mapped Display User Guide for an explanation of the 
     layers program.)

     \Sshl\S has its own language that you use to create up to seven shells,
     and that you use to move from one shell to another.  When you create a new
     shell and are working there, it is referred to as your current layer.  The
     current layer is the only shell that receives input from you.  Hitting the
     control key and the character "z" simultaneously, control-z, prints the
     prompt ">>>".  You can exit \Sshl\S by typing "quit" or, type the name of
     another layer you would like to move to.  The new shell becomes your
     current layer.  Unless you redirect or block a shell's output, the output
     for all processes that you are running in a shell is sent to your terminal.
     This occurs even if the shell is not your current layer.  See the manual
     page for \Sshl\S for the details on its language.  See also:  sh(1) for a
     command with a function similar to \Sshl\S.
