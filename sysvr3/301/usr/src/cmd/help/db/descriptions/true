\Strue\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  true

Description:
     The primary use for \Strue\S is to create an infinite loop in a shell
     program.  \Strue\S does this by setting the exit status to zero.  The
     loop in the program continues until it encounters a "break" or "exit" in
     the loop. See glossary(1) for a description of exit status.  See also:
     false(1) for a command with a function similar to \Strue\S.
