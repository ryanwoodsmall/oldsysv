\Snohup\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  nohup command

         where:  command  is a UNIX system command, a shell program,
                          or an executable file and any arguments
                          it might take.
Description:
     \Snohup\S stands for do "not hang up."  \Snohup\S insures that the
     command will be executed even if your terminal is disconnected from the
     system.  Normally, logging off the system stops the execution of commands,
     including processes that are running in the background.  If you run a
     command in the background and run it with \Snohup\S, logging off will not
     terminate it.  You can terminate the command with the kill(1) command.  
     The output and error output for the command is directed to a file named
     nohup.out unless you redirect it to another file. See also:  kill(1) and
     nice(1) for commands that might be used with \Snohup\S.
