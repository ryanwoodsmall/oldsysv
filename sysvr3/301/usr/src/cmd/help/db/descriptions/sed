\Ssed\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      sed [-n] [script] [file_name ...]
      sed [-n] [-e script] [-f script_file] [file_name ...]

         where:  script  is a list of editing commands.

                 script_file  is the name of a file.

                 file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Ssed\S stands for "stream editor." Use \Ssed\S to change the contents
     of a file when it is sent to standard output or when it will be used as
     input to another command. \Ssed\S does not change the contents of the
     original file.  \Ssed\S changes files according to commands in a script
     or a script file. The scripts are composed of the addresses of the lines
     to be edited, (i.e., either line numbers or regular expressions), the
     commands to change them, and arguments for the commands.  \Ssed\S is
     different from ed(1) and red(1), because they copy the entire file into a
     buffer and edit the file one command line at a time.  \Ssed\S copies one
     line of text at a time into a buffer, and edits the line according to all
     the commands in the script, or script file, that apply.  \Ssed\S prints
     the modified copy of the file on your terminal unless you redirect it.
     For more details on scripts, see the manual page for \Ssed\S.
