\Stail\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  tail [+|-[number] [b|l|c] [-f] [file_name]

         where:  number  is an integer that specifies a distance
                         from the beginning or end of the file.

                 file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Stail\S prints the contents of a file starting from a point that you
     specify.  Use \Stail\S if you want to see only a portion of the contents
     of a file.  With only a file name as an argument, \Stail\S prints the
     last 10 lines of the file.  You specify where you want \Stail\S to begin
     by specifying <number> and a "+" for number of lines from the beginning or
     "-" for number of lines from the end.  With an option, \Stail\S positions
     itself either <number> blocks, lines, or characters from the beginning or
     end of the file.  For example, if you use "+6" as an argument, \Stail\S
     begins printing on line 7 of standard input.  \Stail\S prints standard
     input if you do not specify a file name.  See also:  split(1) and pg(1)
     for commands that function similar to \Stail\S.
