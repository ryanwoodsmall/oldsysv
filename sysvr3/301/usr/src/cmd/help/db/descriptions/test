\Stest\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  test logical_expr
                 [logical_expr]

         where:  logical_expr  is a logical expression consisting
                               of primaries and logical operators.
Description:
     Use \Stest\S in shell programs to evaluate and compare the type and size
     of files, strings, and integers.  You combine file names, strings, and
     integers with arithmetic and logical operators to create logical
     expressions.  If \Stest\S evaluates the expression as true, it sets the
     exit status to zero.  If \Stest\S evaluates the expression as false, or
     if the expression is incomplete or omitted, \Stest\S sets the exit status
     to a non-zero number.  You can perform the same tests on expressions
     without explicitly stating \Stest\S.  You do this by surrounding an
     expression with blanks and square brackets.  
     See the manual pages for \Stest\S for details on creating expressions.
