Description:
     \Srsh\S stands for "restricted shell." \Srsh\S is a restricted version
     of the standard command programming language, sh(1).  Use \Srsh\S to
     execute commands. \Srsh\S takes the commands from a file, the command
     line, or from standard input.  \Srsh\S is most often used to create
     restricted login environments that are more controlled than those of the
     standard shell.  The restrictions for \Srsh\S do not allow you to change
     directories, set the value of PATH, or redirect standard output.  These
     rules make it possible to restrict users to one directory so that they do
     not move around a file system.  The manual pages for sh(1) list the 
     details of \Srsh\S.  See also:  sh(1) for a command with a function 
     similar to \Srsh\S.
