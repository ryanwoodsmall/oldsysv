Description:
     The system invokes \Slogin\S when you establish a connection with a
     computer that runs UNIX systems.  \Slogin\S requests your login name and
     your password to identify you as a user of the system.  \Slogin\S then
     sets up the characteristics of your terminal and identifies your user ID,
     group ID, and current working directory.  If you have more than one login
     name, and you want to login under another login name, you can use
     \Slogin\S to log in again.  To replace the initial login you type "exec
     \Slogin\S".  \Slogin\S can take your login name and environment variable
     assignments as arguments. When you use it this way, \Slogin\S assigns or
     reassigns the values of your environment variables.  See the manual pages
     for \Slogin(1)\S for details on the environment variables.
