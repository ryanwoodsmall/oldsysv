\Sdirname\S: Description

Syntax Summary:   dirname path_name

         where:  path_name  is a full or relative path name.

Description:
     \Sdirname\S stands for "directory name."  Use \Sdirname\S to identify
     the path name of the parent directory of a file or directory.  This
     command drops the file name or directory name that is at the end of
     the path and prints the path name of the directory to standard output.
     The primary use of \Sdirname\S is in shell programs to identify parent
     directories.  See also:  basename(1) for a command with a function
     similar to \Sdirname\S.
