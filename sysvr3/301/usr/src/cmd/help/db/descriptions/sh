Description:
     \Ssh\S stands for "shell", which is the standard command programming
     language  of UNIX systems.  Use \Ssh\S as a command to execute other UNIX
     system commands.  You can execute commands from a file, the command line,
     or from standard input. Unless otherwise specified, the system expects the
     first argument on the \Ssh\S command line to be the name of a file that
     contains commands.  A detailed explanation is available on the manual 
     pages for \Ssh\S.  See also:  rsh(1) for a command with a function 
     similar to \Ssh\S.
