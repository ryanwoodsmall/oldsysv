\Srm\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  rm [-fi] file_name ...
                 rm -r [-fi] name ...

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

                 name  is the name of a file or directory.

Description:
     \Srm\S stands for "remove".  Use \Srm\S to remove files and
     directories.  \Srm\S followed by file names, removes the files, but you
     must use the "r" option to remove non-empty directories.  With the "r"
     option and a directory name, \Srm\S recursively removes all the files and
     subdirectories from a directory, then removes the directory itself.  You
     must have write permission for the directory in order to remove it.  To
     remove a file, you must have write permission for the file and the
     directory.  You can remove all the files in a directory by typing "rm *".
     Use \Srm\S carefully!  Once you remove files, you cannot replace them
     easily.  See also:  rmdir(1) for a command with a function similar to 
     \Srm\S.
