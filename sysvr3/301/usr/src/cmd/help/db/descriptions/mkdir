\Smkdir\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  mkdir dir_name ...

         where:  dir_name  is the name of a directory.

Description:
     \Smkdir\S creates new directories.  When you create a directory with
     \Smkdir\S, it is empty.  If you give \Smkdir\S a simple directory name as
     an argument, the new directory will be a subdirectory of the current
     directory. If you give \Smkdir\S a full or relative path name, you can
     make new directories anywhere in the file system. To create a new
     directory, you must have permission to write in the directory where the
     new directory will exist.  See also:  cd(1) for a command that might be
     used with \Smkdir\S.
