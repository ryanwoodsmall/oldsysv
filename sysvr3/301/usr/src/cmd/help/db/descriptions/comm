\Scomm\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  comm [-123] file_name1 file_name2

         where:  file_names  are names of files.

Description:
     \Scomm\S stands for "common." \Scomm\S compares the contents of two
     files.  Use \Scomm\S to identify the lines that files have in common and
     those that they do not.  \Scomm\S reports the results of the comparison
     in three columns. Column one lists the lines only in <file_name1>, column
     two lists those only in <file_name2>, and column three lists the lines 
     that are common to both files. The options suppress any or all of the 
     columns.  \Scomm\S can compare one file to standard input if you replace 
     either file name with "-".  See also:  bdiff(1), comp(1), diff(1), 
     diff3(1), dircmp(1), and sdiff(1) for commands with functions similar to
     \Scomm\S.
