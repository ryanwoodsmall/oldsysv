\Swait\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  wait [process_ID]

         where:  process_ID  is a process identification number.

Description:
     Use \Swait\S to delay the execution of commands until active processes
     that are running in the background are complete.  Normally, the shell
     starts a command in the background, then moves on to the next command and
     executes it.  If you execute \Swait\S, \Swait\S stops the execution of
     additional commands until the first is finished.  If you use \Swait\S in
     a shell program, \Swait\S delays the execution of the commands that
     follow it until the commands executed in the background are complete.  You
     can also use \Swait\S with a <process_ID> as an argument.  The execution
     of the later commands will depend on the completion of the process with
     that <process_ID>.  The process ID must be for a process that is 
     running in the background of the current shell.  \Swait\S delays messages 
     about the abnormal termination of the commands until all commands from 
     the background are complete.
