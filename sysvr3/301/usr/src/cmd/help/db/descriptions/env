\Senv\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      env [-] var_name=string ... command
      env [var_name=string ...]


         where:  var_name  is an environmental variable name.


                 string  is a sequence of characters delimited by
                         white space and/or double quotes.

                 command  is a UNIX system command, a shell program,
                          or an executable file and any arguments
                          it might take.



Description:
     \Senv\S stands for "environment." Use \Senv\S to change the value of
     environmental variables for the execution of a command.  Environmental
     variables are normally set by your .profile program when you log in.
     Without any arguments \Senv\S lists the variables in the environment and
     their values.  With one or more variable assignments as arguments, \Senv\S
     includes the new values for the variables in the list.  When a variable
     assignment and a command are arguments to \Senv\S, the command is
     executed using the new value of the variable.  When you use the 
     "-" option, \Senv\S ignores the environment that the system sets up 
     when you login.  The environment the command is executed with is the one 
     you create with variable assignments on the command line.
