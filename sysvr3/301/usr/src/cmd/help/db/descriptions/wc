\Swc\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  wc [-clw] file_name ...

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Swc\S counts the number of characters, words and lines in a file.  When
     you specify one or more files, the name of the file is printed along with
     the counts.  The options cause \Swc\S to count words, lines, or
     characters or any combination.  If you do not specify a file name on the
     command line, \Swc\S reads from the standard input.  See also:  ls(1) and
     size(1) for commands with functions similar to \Swc\S.
