\Smv\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  mv [-f] original_file destination_file
                 mv [-f] original_file ... destination_dir
                 mv [-f] original_dir ... destination_dir

         where:  original_file and destination_file  are names of files.

                 original_dir and destination_dir  are names of directories.

Description:
     \Smv\S stands for "move."  Use \Smv\S to move one or more files from
     one location to another.  The <original_file> no longer exists after you
     move it to the <destination file> or <destination_dir>.  If
     <destination_file> already exists, the <original_file> will over write its
     contents. \Smv\S can move more than one file as long as the destination
     is a directory.  \Smv\S can also move directories, but the <original_dir>
     and the <destination_dir> must have the same parent directory.  In effect,
     using \Smv\S on a directory really just renames the directory.  To use
     \Smv\S, you must have write permission in the directory where you're moving
     the file from as well as the directory you're moving the file to. See
     also:  cp(1) and ln(1) for commands with functions similar to \Smv\S.
