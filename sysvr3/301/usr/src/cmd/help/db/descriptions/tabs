Syntax Summary:

           [+mmargin] [-Tterminal_type] [--file_name]

         where:  canned, repetitive, and arbitrary  are strings.

                 file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Stabs\S sets the tab stops on your terminal.  Use a tab specification
     from among the <canned> tab specifications to set your tab stops to match
     the normal tab stops for different computer languages.  You create your
     own tab specifications with integers for <arbitrary> and <repetitive>. 
     With <repetitive> you specify tabs that will be set at regular intervals.
     <arbitrary> gives you a way to set tabs at irregular intervals.  You can
     also create a tab specification in a file and use <file_name> on the
     command line.  The "T" option allows you to set the tab stops as they
     would be set for a certain terminal type.  If you don't specify your 
     tab stops, they are set every 8 characters.  For more information read 
     the manual page for \Stabs\S.
