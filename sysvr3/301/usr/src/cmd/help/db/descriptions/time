\Stime\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  time command

         where:  command  is a UNIX system command, a shell program,
                          or an executable file and any arguments
                          it might take.

Description:
     \Stime\S tells you how long a command takes to execute. \Stime\S
     prints the real time which is the number of seconds that elapsed between
     the time you typed the command and when you got your shell prompt back.
     It prints the user time which is the time spent executing the command,
     and system time which is the time that it took to execute system code.
     User time and system time do not add up to real time, because real time
     includes printing the output.  The output of the \Stime\S command is sent
     to standard error which is not always the same as standard output.  If you
     think of several different ways to do something using UNIX commands, you
     can use \Stime\S to identify the most efficient one.  See also: timex(1)
     for a command whose function is similar to \Stime\S.
