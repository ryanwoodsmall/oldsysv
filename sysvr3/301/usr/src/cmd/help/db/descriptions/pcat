\Spcat\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  pcat file_name ...

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Spcat\S prints the files that you compressed with pack(1).  Use \Spcat\S
     to read one or more packed files without returning the files to their
     original form.  \Spcat\S prints each file in its original form without
     disturbing the compressed form in <file_name.z>.  \Spcat\S prints a files
     whether you refer to it as <file_name.z> or <file_name>.  \Spcat\S lists
     the names of files that it cannot print.  \Spcat\S might not print files
     because they are not the product of pack(1), the file names have too many
     characters, or it cannot open them.  See also:  pack(1), unpack(1) for
     commands that might be used with \Spcat\S.
