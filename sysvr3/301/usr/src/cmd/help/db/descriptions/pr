Description:
     \Spr\S stands for "print".  Use \Spr\S to format and print the contents
     of a file.  If you don't list a <file_name> or if you use "-" in place of
     a <file_name>, \Spr\S reads and prints standard input.  Without options,
     \Spr\S breaks the text into pages, and puts a heading on each page.  The
     heading contains the file name, the date, and the time it was last
     modified. The options for \Spr\S allow you to create many different
     formats.  For example, you can change the page length and width, print the
     file in multi-column form, print line numbers, or change the header.  See
     also:  cat(1) and pg(1) for commands with functions similar to \Spr\S.
