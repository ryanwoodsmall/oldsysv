\Ssdiff\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:
      sdiff [-l] [-s] [-o output_file] [-w width] file_name1 file_name2

         where:  file_names and output_files  are names of files.

                 width  is an integer.

Description:
     \Ssdiff\S stands for "side-by-side" difference. \Ssdiff\S shows the
     differences in the contents of two files. Use \Ssdiff\S to list the
     lines of the two files in columns next to each other.  Between the columns
     are symbols that show how the lines differ.  "<" means the line is only in
     <file_name1>.  ">" means that the line is only in <file_name2>.  "|"
     indicates that the lines are different.  If the lines are identical, the
     space between the columns is empty.  Using the options for \Ssdiff\S you
     can change the width of the output lines, or create a third file that is
     composed of portions of <file_name1> and <file_name2>.  You can also
     suppress identical lines or have \Ssdiff\S print them only in the left
     column.  See also:  bdiff(1), cmp(1), comm(1), and diff(1), diff3(1), and
     dircmp(1) for commands with functions similar to \Ssdiff\S.
