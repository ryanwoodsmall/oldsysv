\Sfalse\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  false

Description:
     The primary use for \Sfalse\S is to create an infinite loop in a shell
     program.  \Sfalse\S does this by setting the exit status to a non-zero
     number.  The loop in the program continues until it encounters "break" or
     "exit" in the loop.  See glossary(1) for a description of exit status.
     See also: true(1) for a command with a function similar to false(1).
