\Scut\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  cut -c char_list [file_name ...]
                 cut -f field_list [-d char] [-s] [file_name ...]

         where:  char_list  is a list of integers that identify a character.

                 field_list  is a list of integers that identify a field.

                 file_name  is the name of a file.

                 char  is a separator character.

Description:
     \Scut\S displays one or more specified columns or fields of a file on the
     standard output.  Together with the \Spaste\S command, it can be used to
     reformat data files.  \Scut\S works by identifying characters or fields.
     A field is composed of characters separated from the rest of the line by a
     separator character.  A tab character is the default field separator. 
     \Scut\S counts tabs as one character, even though the tab might be equal
     to 8 spaces. You can display certain fields or characters by specifying a
     <field_list> or <char_list> on the command line.  If you don't specify a
     file name on the command line, \Scut\S reads from the standard input. See
     also: grep(1) and paste(1) for commands that might be used with \Scut\S.
