\Swrite\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  write login_name [terminal_line]

         where:  login_name  is a user login name.

                 terminal_line is a tty number.

Description:
     \Swrite\S sends messages to other users on your system. \Swrite\S
     sends standard input to the user with the login name <login_name>.  After
     you type your message, \Swrite\S notifies you if your message cannot be
     sent because write permission is denied or the user is not logged on.  It
     also notifies you if people can't write to you because write permissions
     to your terminal are off.  If you aren't notified, your message did 
     go through to the other user.  Wait for a response before sending your 
     next message.  Each message should end in signal, "o" for over, and when
     the conversation is over, the suggested signal is "oo" for over and out.
     When both users have ended with "oo" you type control-d and \Swrite\S 
     responds "EOT", and the conversation ends.  Use the <terminal_line> 
     argument to specify the terminal number you want to write to when a 
     user is logged on to two terminals.  See also:  mail(1) for a command 
     whose function is similar to \Swrite\S, and mesg(1) for a command 
     that might be used with \Swrite\S.
