\Swho\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  who [-HTabdlpqrstu] [file_name]
                 who [am i] [am I]

         where:  file_name  is the name of a file.

Description:
     \Swho\S prints information about the users currently logged in on your
     UNIX system.  If you type \Swho\S by itself, it prints the login names,
     tty numbers, and login times for the users who are currently logged on to
     the system.  With options, \Swho\S prints tables containing additional
     information about current users and the system.  \Swho\S usually gets its
     information from /etc/utmp.  If you use a <file_name> on the command line,
     \Swho\S examines <file_name> instead of /etc/utmp for user names, terminal
     lines, login times, elapsed time since last activity, and process ID.
     <file_name> is usually the /etc/wtmp file. \Swho\S with "am i" or "am I" 
     prints the login name of the user who types it.  See also: id(1) for a
     command with a function similar to \Swho\S.
