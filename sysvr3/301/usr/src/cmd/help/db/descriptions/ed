\Sed\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  ed [-] [-x] [-p string] [file_name]

         where:  string  is a sequence of characters delimited by white
                         space and/or double quotes.

Description:
     \Sed\S stands for "editor," and it is a line editor for UNIX systems.
     Use \Sed\S to change the contents of files.  \Sed\S is a line editor
     because you type command lines to change the file.  When you type \Sed\S
     you invoke the editor, which makes a copy of the file you want to edit and
     puts the copy in a buffer.  Everything you type after you invoke the 
     editor is interpreted as a command to move around or to change the text 
     in the buffer. A typical command for \Sed\S might include a line number or 
     regular expression that identifies the lines to be changed, a single
     character for the type of change to be made, and parameters to the command
     such as the text that will be substituted.  The commands in \Sed\S allow
     you to add text as well as change and move text.  Details on \Sed\S are
     available on the manual page and in the \Sed\S tutorial in the "UNIX
     System User's Guide." See also:  ex(1), vi(1), and red(1) for commands
     with function similar to ed(1).
