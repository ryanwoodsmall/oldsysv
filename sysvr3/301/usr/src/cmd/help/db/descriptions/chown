Description:
     \Schown\S stands for "change owner."  Use \Schown\S to change the owner
     of files or directories.  You name a new owner using a login name or
     numeric user ID.  \Schown\S does not change the contents of the files or
     directories, but it does change the owner who has read, write, and execute
     permissions.  You can use \Schown\S only if you are the current owner of
     the files or directories, or if you are the super-user.  After you change
     the owner of your files and directories you can use them only if the 
     access permissions for group or other users permit you to use them.  See
     the glossary for descriptions of access permissions.  See also:  chgrp(1)
     and chmod(1) for commands with functions similar to \Schown\S.
