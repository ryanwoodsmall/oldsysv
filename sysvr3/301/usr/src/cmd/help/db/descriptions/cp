\Scp\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  cp original_file destination_file
                 cp original_file ... destination_dir

         where:  original_file and destination_file  are names of files.

                 destination_dir  is the name of a directory.

Description:
     \Scp\S is shorthand for "copy." Use \Scp\S to copy one file to another
     file without removing the contents of the first file.  You can copy
     <original_file> to a file in your current working directory, or you can
     copy it to a new directory.  \Scp\S will create a file by the same name
     in <destination_dir> if one does not already exist.  If a file by the same
     name does exist, <original_file> will overwrite the contents.
     <destination_dir> must be an existing directory, and you must have
     permission to write into the <destination_dir> and <destination_file>
     before you can use \Scp\S.  See also:  mv(1), and ln(1) for commands with
     functions similar to \Scp\S.
