\Spdp11\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  pdp11

Description:
     The \Spdp11\S command checks the machine ID of the computer it is running
     on.  If the computer is a pdp-11/45 or a pdp-11/70, \Spdp11\S sets the
     exit status to zero, showing that it executed successfully.  If the
     computer is anything other than a pdp-11/45 or pdp-11/70, \Spdp11\S sets
     the exit status to a non-zero number.  Use \Spdp11\S as a test in shell
     programs to identify the type of computer being used.  It insures that the
     system executes the machine-specific lines that are appropriate to the
     pdp-11/45 or pdp-11/70.  See also:  false(1), test(1), true(1), u370(1),
     u3b(1), u3b2(1), u3b5(1), and vax(1) for commands with functions similar  
     to \Spdp11\S, and make(1) for a command that might be used with \Spdp11\S.
