Syntax Summary:  kill [-signal] process_ID ...

         where:  signal  is a positive integer that is a a valid signal

Description:
     Use \Skill\S to terminate a process.  \Skill\S can terminate processes
     that are running in the background or processes that you executed with
     nohup(1). You can only kill a process that you own.  You identify the
     process you want to kill with its process ID number.  The ps(1) command
     lists the process ID numbers for your active processes.  Unless you choose
     a different signal number, \Skill\S uses the terminate signal number 15.
     Different signals are available to terminate processes that ignore a 
     signal number 15.  See signal(2) and glossary(1) for lists of signals. 
     See also:  ps(1) for a command that might be used with \Skill\S.
