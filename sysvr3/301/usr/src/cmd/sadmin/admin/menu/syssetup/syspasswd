#help#	Syspasswd lets you set system passwords normally reserved for the
#help#	very knowledgeable user.  For this reason, this procedure may assign
#help#	those passwords, but may not change or clear them.  Once set, they
#help#	may only be changed by the specific login or the "root" login, using
#help#	the passwd command to change the password.  Therefore, set them with
#help#	care!

#	system logins are those in the /etc/passwd file with user ID < 100
#	and that are not Simple Administration logins.
