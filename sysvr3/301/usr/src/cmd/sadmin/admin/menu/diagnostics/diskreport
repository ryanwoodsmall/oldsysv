#menu#	report on built-in disk errors
#help#
#help#	This subcommand shows you if the system has collected any information
#help#	indicating that there have been errors while reading the built-in
#help#	disks.  You can request either summary or full reports.
#help#	The summary report provides sufficient information about disk errors
#help#	to determine if repair should be attempted.  If the message
#help#				no errors logged
#help#	is part of the report, then there is probably no damage.  If a number
#help#	of errors is reported, there is damage and you should call for service.
#help#	The full report gives additional detail for the expert repair person
#help#	trouble shooting complicated problems.
#help#	NOTE:  Reports of disk errors most probably result in the loss of
#help#	files and/or damage to data.  It will be necessary to restore the
#help#	repaired disk from backup copies.
