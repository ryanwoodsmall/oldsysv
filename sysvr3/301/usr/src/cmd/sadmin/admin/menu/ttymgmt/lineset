#menu# show tty line settings and hunt sequences
#help#
#help#	The tty line settings often are hunt sequences, where, if the
#help#	first line setting does not work, the line "hunts" to the next line
#help#	setting, until one that works comes by.  This subcommand shows the
#help#	various sequences of line settings.  It also shows each line
#help#	setting in detail.
