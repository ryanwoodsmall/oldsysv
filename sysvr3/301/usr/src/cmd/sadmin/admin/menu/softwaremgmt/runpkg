#help#	This package allows you to run software from a removable medium without
#help#	installing it permanently on the system.  This is useful if you
#help#	don't use the software often or do not have enough room on the system.
#help#	WARNING:  Not all software packages have the ability to run their
#help#	contents this way.  See the instructions which came with the medium.
