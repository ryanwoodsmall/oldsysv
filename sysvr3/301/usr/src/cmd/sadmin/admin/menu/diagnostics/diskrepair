To repair a disk without causing unnecessary damage, the system must be as
inactive as we can make it.  This state, traditionally known as "single user",
can be entered by logging in as "root" on the console terminal, and typing:

				init 1

Note that this is not the traditional way to get to "single user" state.

echo '
When you get the "#" prompt on the console, use "/etc/mount" to be sure that
only the "/" file system is mounted and "ps" to be sure that the only
processes are:
			Process ID 0
			Process ID 1
			-su
			ps
If there is more than the "/" file system or more than these processes,
something has gone wrong.  Be sure all other processes are killed
and all file systems other than "/" are unmounted before going further.
'
checklist -f ${flags} 'Press RETURN to continue. [q]' '' '<RETURN>'
echo '
Now, with the system quiet, you may run the program that repairs the disk.
Type:
			/etc/hdefix -a
The program will repair each of the reported bad blocks.

As a result of this repair, some file system damage may occur.  This damage
may be detected by the "/etc/fsck" program used during the start up sequence.
"/etc/fsck" may report damage and its repair.
NOTE:  Even if "/etc/fsck" does not report any damage, some files within
the file system may be corrupted.  (After all, bad blocks get reported when
attempts to access them fail.)  Ideally, the file systems should be emptied
and restored from the most recent backups to ensure that there are no damaged
files.  Use the command
			sysadm restore
to restore the file systems.
