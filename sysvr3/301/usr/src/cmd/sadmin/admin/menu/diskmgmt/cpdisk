#menu# make exact copies of a removable medium
#help# 
#help#	This procedure copies the contents of a removable medium into the
#help#	machine and makes exact copies of it.  These copies are identical to
#help#	the original in every way.
#help#	The copies are made by first reading the original removable medium
#help#	entirely into the machine and then writing it out onto duplicates.
#help#	The procedure will fail if there is not enough space in the
#help#	system to hold the original medium.
#help#	If there are two or more drives of the same type on the system,
#help#	you can request that the copy be directly from one to the other,
#help#	in which case the space limitation (above) does not hold.
##help#	When copying between dissimilar drives, the smaller one dominates.
