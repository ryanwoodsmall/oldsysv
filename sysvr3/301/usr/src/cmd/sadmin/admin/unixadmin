	# The problem is that we want the commands to (potentially) have a
	# password, so that they can be restricted if the user likes, and
	# to be within the restricted shell so that the user can not break out
	# and become super-user.  The complication is that we want the command
	# to have arguments, but /bin/su will not permit arguments to something
	# that has /bin/rsh as its login shell and /bin/su clears out the
	# environment when the - argument is used.  So we open another File
	# Descriptor and ship the arguments in via a pipe.
	#	make File Descriptor 4 the same as 0 (standard input)
	exec 4<&0
	#	echo the arguments down a pipe.  On the receiving end,
	#	connect the pipe to File Descriptor 3 and connect the original
	#	standard input, available on FD 4, to FD 0.  Lastly, close FD 4.
	#	See the .profile file (admin profile.dot) for how the arguments
	#	are read.
