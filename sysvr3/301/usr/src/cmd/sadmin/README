	Simple Administration (sadmin) software

UPDATING A PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED SIMPLE ADMINISTRATION
	If a previous installation of sadmin is in place and you intend to 
replace that one with a new one, perform the following sequence to remove 
the installed product, clobber intermediate files in the source tree, 
remove the previous source files and remove the source tree directory 
structure.  See the note about INSTALLING UNDER A DIFFERENT ROOT, below.

		make -f sadmin.mk ROOT=`pwd`/installdir remove clobber
		rm -f `make -f sadmin.mk partslist`
		find * -type d -print  |  sort -r  |  xargs rmdir

Then install all the new source files and follow the instructions below.
It is possible to install new source without going through this sequence,
but there is a chance that it won't work because of name collisions and the
like.  This is guaranteed to give a clean sweep and properly build the product.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
All source files are installed under a single directory, traditionally
/usr/src/cmd/sadmin.

All the product pieces are built by the issuing the command
		make -f sadmin.mk

All the product pieces are installed by the super-user issuing the command
		make -f sadmin.mk install

INSTALLING UNDER A DIFFERENT ROOT
The installation above installs relative to /.  The relative position of 
these files can be modified by adding a ROOT:
		make -f sadmin.mk ROOT=`pwd`/installdir install

This will make the file in "installdir" below the current directory.
DO NOT set  ROOT=`pwd` !  It will wipe out your source!


On the final system, the following must be done:

/etc/passwd must have the following entries:
	sysadm::0:0:general system administration:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
	setup::0:0:first time setup:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
	powerdown::0:0:power down machine:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
	checkfsys::0:0:check diskette file system:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
	makefsys::0:0:make diskette file system:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
	mountfsys::0:0:mount diskette file system:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
	umountfsys::0:0:unmount diskette file system:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
(This can be found in admin/passwd after the product is built.)

NOTE:	This old way of defining removable disk device to SA will work
	for a while, but there must be only one such device.
Link /dev/diskette to the largest block device of the diskette
e.g.	ln /dev/ifdsk00 /dev/diskette
Link /dev/rdiskette to the largest character device of the diskette
e.g.	ln /dev/rifdsk00 /dev/rdiskette

BUG!!!  This does not work with System V Release 2 mount(1M) and umount(1M)!
Note:	To define one or more removable disk or tape device to SA:
		mkdir /dev/SA /dev/rSA
		chmod 755 /dev/SA /dev/rSA
In /dev/SA, link the largest block devices for the removable media.  Give
them the names you want them to be know as when the user is asked to select
one.  E.g.:
		ln /dev/dsk/10s1 /dev/SA/diskette1
		ln /dev/dsk/11s1 /dev/SA/diskette2
		ln /dev/mt/0m /dev/SA/tape0
Similarly, the same must be done for character (raw) devices.  E.g.:
		ln /dev/rdsk/0s1 /dev/rSA/diskette1
		ln /dev/rdsk/1s1 /dev/rSA/diskette2
		ln /dev/rmt/0m /dev/rSA/tape0
end BUG!!!

Assuming that
	init state 0 takes the machine down and turns off the power
	init state 1 takes the machine down and goes to single-user state
	init state 2 is traditional multi-user
	init state 5 takes the machine down and goes to firmware
	init state 6 takes the machine down and reboots UNIX OS
etc/inittab must have the following entries:
3B2 ONLY!!!
	s2:2:wait:/etc/rc2 >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	fl:056:wait:/etc/restart -f >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	s0:056:wait:/etc/rc0 >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	of:0:wait:/etc/uadmin 2 0 >/dev/console 2>&1	# turn off power
	fw:5:wait:/etc/uadmin 2 2 >/dev/console 2>&1	# return to firmware
	RB:6:wait:echo Automatic Reboot >/dev/console 2>&1
	rb:6:wait:/etc/uadmin 2 1 >/dev/console 2>&1	# reboot
	su:1:wait:/etc/shutdown -is -y -g0 </dev/console >/dev/console 2>&1	# go to single user mode
3B5 ONLY!!!!
	s2:2:wait:/etc/rc2 >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	fl:056:wait:/etc/restart -f >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	s0:056:wait:/etc/rc0 >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	of:0:wait:echo You may now turn off the power. >/dev/console 2>&1
	fw:5:wait:/etc/restart >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	rb:6:wait:echo You may now reboot UNIX. >/dev/console 2>&1
	su:1:wait:/etc/shutdown -is -y -g0 </dev/console >/dev/console 2>&1	# go to single user mode
ALL OTHER MACHINES
	s2:2:wait:/etc/rc2 >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	fl:056:wait:/etc/restart -f >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	s0:056:wait:/etc/rc0 >/dev/console 2>&1 </dev/console
	of:0:wait:echo You may now turn off the power. >/dev/console 2>&1
	fw:5:wait:echo You may now go to firmware. >/dev/console 2>&1
	rb:6:wait:echo You may now reboot UNIX. >/dev/console 2>&1
	su:1:wait:/etc/shutdown -is -y -g0 </dev/console >/dev/console 2>&1	# go to single user mode

There needs to be a file  /etc/fstab .
This file contains the mount information for all file systems (except /)
to be mounted when the machine is in multi-user state.
Its format is tab separated columns.
	Column 1	Block special device (e.g. /dev/idsk02)
	Column 2	Mount point directory (e.g. /usr)
	Column 3	optional  -r  indicating "mount read-only"
Lines beginning with  #  are comments.


MISCELLANEOUS make TARGETS
Note:
    All the following use the same ROOT conventions as "make install", above.

To list all product files created by "make install", type
	make -f sadmin.mk product

To list all product directories created by "make install", type
	make -f sadmin.mk productdir

To create a PROTO file, see mkfs(1M), for the product files installed, type
	make -f sadmin.mk proto
(This will only work after a  make install  has been done.)

To list all parts (delivered) files, type
	make -f sadmin.mk partslist

To list all commands used within Simple Administration shell scripts, type
	make -f sadmin.mk cmdsused

To clean out all intermediate files from the source directories (i.e. *.o), type
	make -f sadmin.mk clean

To clean out all intermediate and final product files
from the source directories, type
	make -f sadmin.mk clobber

To remove the product files from the installed directories, type
	make -f sadmin.mk remove
(This must be done by the same user who issued  make install .)


RECOMMENDATIONS:
The agefile(1) command can be used to keep logs from growing without bound.
Add the following line to /usr/spool/cron/crontab/root
0 0 * * *	/usr/lbin/agefile -h /usr/lib/cron/log /usr/adm/sulog /etc/wtmp

The spacewatch(1) command can be used to watch over "head room" in the file
systems and give warnings BEFORE they actually run out of free blocks or inodes.
A typical cron line in /usr/spool/cron/crontab/root
10,40 * * * *	/usr/lbin/spacewatch -u -b500 -i100 ALL >/dev/null 2>&1
