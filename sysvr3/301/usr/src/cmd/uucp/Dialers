# Each caller type that appears in the Devices file (5th field)
# should appear in this file except for the built in callers.
# Each line consists of three parts:
# - the name of the caller
# - the translation table for the phone number to translate from
#   the 801 codes (=-) to the code for the particular device
# - a chat script (same format and meaning as the login scripts
#   that appear in the Systems file.
#
# Meaning of some of the escape characters:
# \p - pause (approximately 1/4-1/2 second delay)
# \d - delay (2 seconds)
# \D - phone number/token
# \T - phone number with Dialcodes and character translation
# \N - null byte
# \K - insert a BREAK
# \E - turn on echo checking (for slow devices)
# \e - turn off echo checking
# \r - carriage return
# \c - no new-line
# \n - send new-line
# \nnn - send octal number
#
# See the Administration Documentation for more details.
#
# NOTE: blank lines and lines that begin with a <space>, <tab>, or # are ignored

#
#	Commands:	Explanation:
#	------------	---------------------------------------------------
#	=,-,		Use comma for secondary dial tone & for pause
#	""		expect nothing
#	\033\r\r\c	Escape sequences!! This one should work right after
#			power-up and later. If first use after power up,
#			the modem will ignore the escape and see the
#			two carriage returns--and become active and
#			spits out the MODEM: prompt. Otherwise, the modem
#			is already active and the escape followed by the
#			first carriage return tells the modem to go into
#			menu mode, and the second carriage return simply
#			causes the MODEM: prompt to come out.
#	DEM:		expect "DEM:" (actually "MODEM:")
#	\033s0401\c	Turn the speaker off.
#	\006		expct ACK (octal 6)
#	\033s0901\c	DTR should control connection (i.e. dropping DTR
#			drops connection and disallows auto answer)
#	\006		expct ACK (octal 6)
#	\033s1001\c	Ignore the cancel character.
#	\006		expct ACK (octal 6)
#	\033s1102\c	Turn off ability for remote modem to start test
#			in this modem.
#	\006		expct ACK (octal 6)
#	\033dT\T\r\c	Tell the modem to dial the given number, using
#			touch-tone signaling (change the first T to P
#			if you want to use pulse dialing).
#	\006		expct ACK (octal 6)

#  The format of the request to the listener is

#  where <service_code> determines what server the listener invokes.
#  The entry below asks for service code 1.
#
#  If cu & uucico use different service codes, you will have to use 
#  separate Dialers files (e.g., Dialers.cico and Dialers.cu).
#  See comments in Sysfiles for instructions.
