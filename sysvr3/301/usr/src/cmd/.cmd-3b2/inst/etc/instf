HELPFULL="\
The \"Full Restore\" replaces everything on the integral hard disk(s) with
a ${TM} core UNIX  system.  Nothing is assumed to be on the hard
disk(s) and  nothing is retained.  Choose this option only if you have a
brand-new system or are  willing to  DESTROY the files now on  your hard
disk(s)."

PARTIALMSG="\
The \"Partial Restore\" replaces the core files with ${TM} files on 
the integral hard disk(s).  Other files are not affected.  This will UNDO 
your terminal and user login configuration."

HELPPARTIAL="\
The \"Partial Restore\" replaces the core files with ${TM} files. 
It does not destroy user-created files. Note that this RESETS the basic 
configuration (terminals, logins, etc.) to those of a brand-new system. 
This procedure may be useful to  restore a severely damaged system to a 
usable state, or to remove a forgotten \"root\" password."

DUALMSG="\
The \"Dual Disk Upgrade\"  converts an existing  single-disk  system to a dual 
integral disk configuration. It may only be run on a ${OLDTM} system or 
subsequent releases.  Any files already on disk 2 will be LOST. It is highly 
recommended that you have CURRENT  backups of EVERY disk 1  partition BEFORE 
running this procedure."

HELPDUAL="\
The \"Dual Disk Upgrade\" converts an  existing 3B2  single-disk  system to a 
dual integral disk configuration. Existing files on disk 1 are not damaged.
Disk 2 is assumed to be empty; any data on it will be DESTROYED. The \"/usr\"
file system may be moved to disk 2.  Vacated and  new disk space (on disk 1 
and disk 2, respectively) is allocated to one or more additional partitions."

RELEASEMSG="\
The \"Release Upgrade\" option replaces most of the core system files on the
integral hard disk(s) with ${TM} files. The system configuration,
and user files are not affected."

FEATURES="\
	o Floating Boot
	o Floating Point Assist software support
	o XM (expansion module) software support"

HELPRELEASE="\
The \"Release Upgrade\" replaces most of the core system files with those
distributed in ${TM}. User files and most configuration files
are   retained.   Kernel  and  device driver  tunable
parameters in  /etc/master.d  are set to ${TM} default  values.
Optional  packages  must  be reinstalled.
Replaced  configuration files are saved in /usr/old.  Upgrade features 
include:

	PARTITIONMSG="\
The hard disks are divided into several logical partitions.  Those named 
\"root\", \"swap\" and \"usr\" are needed by the system.  Default partitioning
will place \"root\" and \"swap\" on disk 1 and \"usr\" on disk 2.  Their sizes 
cannot be adjusted once the system is active.  Additional partitions may 
also be created at your discretion.  See the \"3B2 Computer System Admin-
istration  Utilities  Guide\"   for more information regarding hard disk
partitioning."
