#help#	This subcommand manages the "inittab" file which
#help#  controls the use of the I/O ports used by
#help#  "Basic Networking Utilities" commands:
#help#	uucp, cu, and ct.
#help#
#help#  Ports that do not appear in the "inittab" file may
#help#  be used for outgoing traffic by uucp, cu, and ct.
#help#  Ports that have status "off" in the "inittab" file
#help#  can also be used for outgoing traffic.
#help#
#help#  Ports that have status "respawn" will be used for
#help#  incoming traffic if a "getty" command appears on
#help#  the 'inittab' line.  They will be used for bidirectional
#help#	traffic if a "uugetty" appears.
