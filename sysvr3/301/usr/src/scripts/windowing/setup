NOTE:
You will have to reboot your system to get the new
"xt" driver installed before using AT&T Windowing.
This can be accomplished by using the simple
administration command "shutdown -g0 -y -i6".

If you have DMD software installed already you should
have /usr/bin before $DMD/bin in your path. This 
will allow you to use either AT&T Windowing or DMD layers.
To use DMD software you should have your DMD variable
set appropriately.
 
The AT&T Windowing Package has been installed in
/usr/bin /usr/lib and /usr/include .
