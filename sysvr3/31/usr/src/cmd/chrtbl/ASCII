#ident	"@(#)chrtbl:ASCII	1.1"

# This is the character definition table for the 
# ASCII character set.
 
# The "chrclass"   indicates the name (identification)
# of the code set this table applies to.


# Any lines with a number sign (#) in column 1 are treated
# as comments and are ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored.
# All hex or octal constants may be sepatated by one or
# more space and tab characters.
# A number can be represented as a hex or octal constant.
#	For example the letter "a" can be represented as
#		0x61 in hex or 0141 in octal.

# The "-" may be used to indicate a range of consecutive
# numbers. 
# Zero or more space characters can be used for separating
# the "-" from the numbers.
# The "\" character is used for continuation.
# No characters are permitted after the continuation character.

# The relationship between upper and lower case letters 
# is expressed as ordered pairs 
# 	<"uppercase character" "lowercase character">
# The two numbers can be separated by one or more space character.
# Zero or more space characters can be used for separating
# the angle brackets from the numbers.

# The "chrtbl" utility will create a C source file named ctype.c, 
# containing the classification and conversion table based on 
# input specification file and a data file with  the
# table elements. This data file must be installed in
# /lib/chrclass directory and its name is the same as
# the value of the environment variable CHRCLASS.
