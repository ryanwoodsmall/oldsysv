   Type the layout as you want it to appear to the user.

   Use % to indicate the end of a description and the beginning of user input.
   Use & to indicate that the field continues on the next line.

   NOTE: If you want a %, &, or # character to appear in your text, then you
         must take away the special meaning of the character by preceding
         it with a backslash. (# is used on menu layouts.)

         Avoid using the tab character in your layout file because it may
         cause alignment errors.

   Here is an sample command form layout:

                NAME(S) OF INPUT FILES(S):%

                OUTPUT OBJECT FILE:%a.out

                SUPPRESS LINK EDIT PHASE \& FORCE AN&
                  OBJECT FILE TO BE PRODUCED [-o] (y/n):%n
