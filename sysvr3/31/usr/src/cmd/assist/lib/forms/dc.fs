This is an interactive command.  If you specify a file, the
program will read to the end of file, and then take input
from standard input.  If you do not specify a file, it will
begin reading from standard input immediately.  In either case,
you must terminate the command by typing ^D.

"dc" invokes an interactive stacking calculator.
You must exit the "dc" program by typing control-d
(^D).

00Enter the name of the file containing "dc" commands.  If you specify
a file, the command will execute all of the "dc" commands in the
file, and then begin reading instructions from your keyboard.  
Type ^D to terminate input.
01ASSIST appends anything you type here to the command line.
You can use this field for "piping," "redirection," or to
execute a command in the "background."  However, since
ASSIST does not perform any error checking on this field,
you should use it with caution.
