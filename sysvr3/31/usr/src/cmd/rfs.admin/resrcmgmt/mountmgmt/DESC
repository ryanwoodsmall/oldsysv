#head# 		REMOTE RESOURCE MOUNTING AND INFO MANAGEMENT
#help# 
#help#	You access remote resources from other server machines  
#help#	in your domain by mounting them on a directory in your 
#help#	own file system.  The subcommands of the Mount Remote  
#help#	Resource Management Menu allow you to handle all aspects 
#help#	of mounting remote resources from server machines in your 
#help#	domain.  The subcommands provide two information lists: 
#help#	one that lists remote resources available for mounting, 
#help#	and one that lists remote resources that are already locally 
#help#	mounted.  The subcommands allow you to mount and unmount 
#help#	remote resources and to add and remove resource from the 
#help#	Automatic Mount List.  Your system will attempt to mount 
#help#	the remote resources on this list each time RFS is started.
