#head# 		LOCAL RESOURCE ADVERTISING AND INFO MANAGEMENT
#help# 
#help#	You offer to share your local resources with other 
#help#	machines by advertising them.  The subcommands of the
#help#	Local Resource Offering Management Menu allow you to handle
#help#	all aspects of advertising local resources to other machines.
#help# 	The subcommands let you list the local resources you have
#help# 	offered (advertised), and let you see which of your local
#help#	resources are mounted by other machines.  The subcommands
#help#	also allow you to advertise and unadvertise your local
#help#	resources, and to add and remove them from the Automatic 
#help#	Advertise List.  Resources in this list are advertised 
#help#	automatically whenever RFS is started.
