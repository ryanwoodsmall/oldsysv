#help# 	Remote File Sharing Management Menus help you set up and
#help#	maintain the UNIX Remote File Sharing (RFS) feature.  
#help#	Remote File Sharing allows computers to selectively share 
#help#	resources over a transport provider.  Resources are directories
#help#	that may contain files, subdirectories, devices, and / or 
#help#	named pipes.  These submenus and subcommands help you to set up
#help#	and manage a group of machines, share your local resources,
#help#	connect to remote resources, and start and stop RFS.
