#help#	The subcommand "addmember" allows you to add machines as 
#help#	members of a domain if you are the primary name server 
#help#	for that domain.   When a machine has been added as a
#help#	member of your domain it may share resources advertised
#help#	in your domain.  This subcommand may ONLY be accessed 
#help#	from PRIMARY machines.

HEADING="
Every machine must be a member of a domain. The primary name server machine
for a domain maintains the list of machines that are members of its domain.

This subcommand allows the primary name server to add machines to the 
list of domain members.  The addition takes effect immediately.  When
a machine is added as a member of a domain it may share resources
available in that domain."

QUEST1="
Enter the node name of a machine to be added as a member of your
domain [?, q]:"

HELP1="
The machine you enter will be added to your RFS domain.  When a machine
has been added, that machine can start RFS and share resources in
your domain.

Machine name must be 1 to 8 printable characters.  Names must
not contain a space, \":\", \"/\", or \".\".

After entering the machine name you will be prompted for a password
for the member machine.   The administrator of the added machine
will need to know the password that you assign."

QUEST2="
Do you want to add another member machine?"
