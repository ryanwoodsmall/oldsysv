\Svax\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  vax

Description:
     The \Svax\S command checks the machine ID of the computer it is running
     on.  If the computer is a VAX-11/750 or a VAX-11/780, \Svax\S sets the
     exit status to zero showing that it executed successfully.  If the
     computer is anything other than a VAX-11/750 or VAX-11/780, \Svax\S sets
     the exit status to a non-zero number.  Use \Svax\S as a test in shell
     programs to identify the type of computer.  It insures that the system
     executes the machine-specific lines that are appropriate to the VAX-
     11/750 or VAX-11/780.  See also:  false(1), pdp11(1), sh(1), test(1),
     true(1), u370(1), u3b(1), u3b2(1), and u3b15(1) for commands with
     functions similar to \Svax\S, and make(1) for a command that might be
     used with \Svax\S.  See the manual page for cpp(1) for an explanation of
     the "D" option.
