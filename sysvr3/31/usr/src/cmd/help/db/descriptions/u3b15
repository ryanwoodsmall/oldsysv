\Su3b15\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  u3b15

Description:
     The \Su3b15\S command checks the machine ID of the computer it is running
     on.  If the computer is an AT&T 3B15 computer, \Su3b15\S sets the exit
     status to zero showing it executed successfully.  If the computer is
     anything other than a 3B15, \Su3b15\S sets the exit status to a non-zero
     number.  Use \Su3b15\S as a test in shell programs to identify the type
     of computer.  It insure that the system executes the machine-specific
     lines that are appropriate to the 3B15.  See also:  false(1), pdp11(1),
     sh(1), test(1), true(1), u370(1), u3b(1), u3b2(1), and vax(1) for
     commands with functions similar to \Su3b15\S, and make(1) for a command
     that might be used with \Su3b15\S.  See the manual page for cpp(1) for an
     explanation of the "D" option.
