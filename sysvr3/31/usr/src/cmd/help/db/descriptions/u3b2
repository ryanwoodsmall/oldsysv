\Su3b2\S:  Description

Syntax Summary:  u3b2

Description:
     \Su3b2\S stands for "UNIX 3B2". The \Su3b2\S command checks the
     machine ID of the computer it is running on.  If the computer is an
     AT&T 3B2 computer, \Su3b2\S sets the exit status to zero showing that
     it executed successfully.  If the computer is anything other than a u3b2,
     \Su3b2\S sets the exit status to a non-zero number.  Use \Su3b2\S as a test
     in shell programs to identify the type of computer.  It insures that the
     system executes the machine specific lines that are appropriate to the
     3B2.  See also:  false(1), pdp11(1), sh(1), test(1), true(1), u370(1),
     u3b(1), u3b15(1), and vax(1) for commands with functions similar to
     \Su3b2\S, and make(1) for a command that might be used with \Su3b2\S.
