   The ASSIST Software Release 1.0, includes a menu/form interface to 
   the UNIX system ("assist"), and a menu/form development tool ("astgen").
   The binary files and libraries for "assist" and "astgen" require 2664 
   blocks of space in /usr.  At installation time, you have the option
   to install "assist" and "astgen", or just "assist".  If you specify "assist"
   only, you will use two floppy  disks for installation.  If you specify
   "assist" and "astgen",  you will use three floppy disks for installation. 
   You can save 460 blocks of space if you only install "assist".  You
   can always install "astgen" at a later date by reinstalling the three
   floppy disks.  The installation procedure checks to ensure that there is 
   enough space.  
  
   The following list shows where the files are located:
  
          Component                             Directory

          "assist"                              /usr/bin
          "astgen"                              /usr/bin
          executables                           /usr/lib/assist/bin
          datafiles                             /usr/lib/assist/lib
             "astgen"                           /usr/lib/assist/lib/astgen
             menu/command form                  /usr/lib/assist/lib/forms
             search                             /usr/lib/assist/lib/search
             setup                              /usr/lib/assist/lib/setup
             walkthru                           /usr/lib/assist/lib/scripts

   The directories listed above are the default directories.  The Release
   Notes provide information describing the modifications necessary to
   install ASSIST in a location other than the default.

   When users invoke ASSIST for the first time, or when they use a different
   type of terminal, ASSIST does some preliminary checks and verifications 
   with a module called setup.  Setup does these checks by showing a 
   series of test patterns and asking questions about what is seen on the 
   screen.  

   ASSIST's programs include:

   "assist"
        "assist" makes using the UNIX system easier.  It helps you 
        locate a UNIX system command and build an executable UNIX
        system command line.  The "assist" program provides a menu
        system that organizes UNIX system commands according to 
        function; command forms, which are interactive versions 
        of UNIX system commands; walkthrus, which are interactive
        simulations of UNIX system commands or concepts; and a 
        key-word-based search for UNIX system commands and options.

   "astgen"
        "astgen" helps users to modify existing menus and command 
        forms, and to create new menus and command forms.
