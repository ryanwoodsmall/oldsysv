# Multiple Floppy INSTALL Script
#
#
# Save mount point of floppy (INSPATH), package name (PKGNAME) and
# information for the mount & umount commands (mntdev & mntname).
#	Note that \fILAST\fR should be set equal to the number of
#	floppy diskettes in the set.  In this example, there are 3 floppies.
#
#	This script has been specially tailored for the cc package.

# Before the actual installation starts, see if this is a pre 3.0 system.
#	If it is, then continue with installation.
#	If this is a 3.0 or later system, notify the customer that
#	the sys header package that came with the core package will
#	be required for installation to be considered complete and give
#	the customer the option of stopping the installation if the
#	package is not available.
