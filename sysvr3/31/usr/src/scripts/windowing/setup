NOTE: You will have to reboot your system to get the new
      "xt" driver installed before using AT&T Windowing.
      This can be accomplished by using the simple admin
      command "shutdown -g0 -y -i6".

      If you have DMD software installed already you should
      have /usr/bin before $DMD/bin in your path. This will
      allow you to use either AT&T Windowing or DMD layers.
      To use DMD software you should have your DMD variable
      set appropriately.
 
      The AT&T Windowing Package has been installed in
      /usr/bin /usr/lib and /usr/include .
