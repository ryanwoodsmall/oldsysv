/*
 *	Each buffer in the pool is usually doubly linked into 2 lists:
 *	the device with which it is currently associated (always)
 *	and also on a list of blocks available for allocation
 *	for other use (usually).
 *	The latter list is kept in last-used order, and the two
 *	lists are doubly linked to make it easy to remove
 *	a buffer from one list when it was found by
 *	looking through the other.
 *	A buffer is on the available list, and is liable
 *	to be reassigned to another disk block, if and only
 *	if it is not marked BUSY.  When a buffer is busy, the
 *	available-list pointers can be used for other purposes.
 *	Most drivers use the forward ptr as a link in their I/O active queue.
 *	A buffer header contains all the information required to perform I/O.
 *	Most of the routines which manipulate these things are in bio.c.
 *
 *      WARNING:  do not change size of the buf structure (sys/buf.h) without 
 *	making a corresponding size change in the rbuf structure (sys/rbuf.h), 
 *  	and vice versa).  The two structures define the two possible formats 
 *	of the buffer header (the format used depends on whether the buffer 
 *	contains local data or RFS data).  
 *
 *      This overlay of the two structures is an interim solution
 *	that is expected to change in a future release.  Users
 *	should be aware that the rbuf structure will probably go
 *	away at that time.
