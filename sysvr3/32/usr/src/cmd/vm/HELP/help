   The HELP command creates an active frame containing a text  message
   which  describes either the action you are trying to perform or the
   current object or form.  From this  context-specific  help  message
   you can navigate through the entire Help facility via  the Table of
   Contents  menu by pressing  the CONTENTS Function Key.  To exit the
   Help facility, press the CANCEL Function Key.

   The following list describes the information that will be presented
   in  the help message.  If a command name is specified with the HELP
   command, a message describing the function, syntax and use  of  the
   command is displayed.

      - menu:  information about the menu's contents

      - form:  definition and field requirements of the form

      - pop-up frame:  information about  the command or form you  are
        trying  to  complete which caused  the pop-up frame to appear,
        or simply about the items in the pop-up menu in  the  case  of
        the FRM-MGMT "list" menu.

      - Command menu:  function, syntax, and use  of  the  highlighted
        command.

      - COMMAND LINE:  a pop-up menu of all commands is presented  for
        you to select the command you would like help on.

      - from a command  prompt:   function,  syntax  and  use  of  the
        command,  including  how to complete any prompts that are part
        of the command procedure.

      - from an error message:  information about the action you  were
        trying to perform when the error occurred.

   To access HELP use one of the following options.  If no argument is
   specified  the system assumes you want help on the current frame or
   on what you are currently doing.

         - Function Key - Press HELP

         - Command menu - Select HELP + RETURN

         - COMMAND LINE - Type help [command_name] + RETURN
