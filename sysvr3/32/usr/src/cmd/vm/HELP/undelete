   The UNDELETE command is a Wastebasket command which allows  you  to
   "undelete"  an  object that is in the Wastebasket.  The object will
   be returned to the folder in the Filecabinet that it was in when it
   was deleted.

   To UNDELETE a Wastebasket object use one of the following  options.
   If an object is not specified the current object is assumed.

      - Command Menu - Select UNDELETE + RETURN

      - Typed Command - Type undelete [object_name] + RETURN

   The object will be removed from the Wastebasket and reappear in the
   Filecabinet folder from which it was deleted.
