   The CREATE command allows you to create new file objects  and  file
   folders. You  can create standard  files, or file folders.  Folders
   can  store  files   or  other  folders.   In  the  example   below,
   "folder_name" is  the pathname  of the folder where the object will
   be created. The pathname  may be relative to the current folder, or
   your filecabinet (include FILECABINET in the pathname), or the full
   UNIX pathname.

     1.  To CREATE an object, use one of the  following  options.  The
         object  will  be  placed  in the currently active folder if a
         destination folder is not specified with the CREATE command.

            - Function Key - Press CHG-KEYS, and then CREATE

            - Command menu - Select CREATE + RETURN

            - COMMAND LINE - Type create [object_name]
                               [in folder_name] + RETURN

     2.  If an "object_name" is not specified, a prompt appears asking
         you  to  enter an object name.  Type in a one word name up to
         12  characters  long  and  press  RETURN.   Note  that   some
         applications may require you to specify a name that is less 
         than 12 characters. If this is the case and you have specified 
	 a name that is too long an error message will display and the 
	 CREATE procedure  will begin  again.

     3.  A pop-up menu frame of object  types  appears.   Select  the
         object  type  you  are creating and press RETURN or the ENTER
         Function  Key.  Pressing the  CANCEL Function Key will cancel
         the CREATE action.

   If  you  are  creating  a  file  folder,  it  will  appear  in  the
   destination folder frame (if open).

   If you are creating a  standard  file,  your  default  editor  will
   automatically be invoked allowing you to begin entering text.
