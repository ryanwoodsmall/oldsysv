   Upon selecting the FRM-MGMT "list" operation a pop-up frame, "Open

   currently open on the screen and all suspended applications.

   You can select a frame or suspended application to  return  to  by
   moving the  cursor  to  the frame name and pressing RETURN.  Press
   CANCEL  if  you  do  not  wish  to  navigate  to a listed frame or
   application.
