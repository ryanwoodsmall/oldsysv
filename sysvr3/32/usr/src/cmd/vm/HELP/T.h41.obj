   An object is the Office frame, the Filecabinet,  a  menu  item,  a
   folder, a standard file, an application (e.g., graph, spreadsheet),
   a data file, a foreign file, or an executable  program.  Generally,
   it is something that is the target of command actions such as copy,
   open and delete.  Some objects  are  not  subject  to  all  of  the
   FACE  commands.   For example, the Filecabinet and the Office
   frame cannot be deleted, and the Office frame cannot be closed.

   When assigning an object name  to  a  Filecabinet  object  you  are
   creating  or  renaming,  it  must  be one word with a maximum of 12
   characters. The following special characters are not  allowed  when
   naming  objects:  ! @ # $ ^ & * [ ] ( ) { } < > ? / | " ' ` ;.  The
   following characters may be used in object names, but  not  as  the
   first character:  . + -.
