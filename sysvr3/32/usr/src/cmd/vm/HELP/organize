   The  ORGANIZE command  allows  you  to change  the presentation of
   objects in a folder.

     1.  To use the ORGANIZE command choose one of the options  below.
         If  a  frame  number is  not  specified the  currently active
         frame is assumed.

            - Command menu - Select ORGANIZE + RETURN

            - COMMAND LINE - Type organize [frame_#]
                               + RETURN

     2.  Fill in the ORGANIZE form by entering your  preferences.  The
         available values for each field are:

         FOLDER DISPLAY TYPE:

            - NAME AND DESCRIPTION (default value):  For each  object,
              its name and description are displayed.

            - NAME ONLY:  For each object, only the name is displayed.

            - LONG  FORM:   For  each   object,   its   name,   object
              description  (if  specified),  object type, and the date
              and time the object was created/changed are displayed.

         FOLDER DISPLAY ORDER:

            - ALPHABETICAL  (default  value):  Names  beginning   with
              numbers  are  displayed first, then names beginning with
              capital letters, followed by names beginning with  lower
              case letters.

            - ALPHABETICAL BY DESCRIPTION:  All objects with the  same
              description  are  grouped  together  and  alphabetically
              sorted within each group.  The object description groups
              are  also  ordered  alphabetically  (e.g.  File  Folders
              before Standard Files).

            - LEAST RECENT:  Objects least recently created or changed
              are displayed first.

            - MOST RECENT:  Objects most recently created  or  changed
              are displayed first.

     3.  Press SAVE to save the settings and close the ORGANIZE  form.
         If the folder you are reorganizing is displayed on the screen
         you will see the changes immediately.

   PREV-FRM, NEXT-FRM, HELP and CMD-MENU):

      - CANCEL - cancels the form frame without saving any changes.

      - CHOICES - For  the  current  field,  pressing  CHOICES  either
        toggles between the possible values for the field, or displays
        a pop-up menu of available choices.

      - SAVE - saves all entries and closes the form frame.

      - RESET - resets the current field back to the value  in  effect
        at the beginning of the current editing session.
