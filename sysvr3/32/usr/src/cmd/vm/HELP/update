   The UPDATE command is used to update the contents of  a  frame  to
   reflect  changes  made  since  the  frame  was  originally opened.
   Currently, the only FACE frames that this  command  has  any
   meaning for are the FIND command "Objects Found" menu.  All  other
   frames  are automatically updated if any changes have been made to
   the contents of the frame.

   To use the UPDATE command, do one of the following  options.  If a
   frame  is  not  specified,  the  current frame is assumed.  In the
   "typed command" syntax, the frame number is the number in the left
   corner of the frame label.

      - Command Menu - Select UPDATE + RETURN

      - Typed Command - Type update [ frame_number] + RETURN
