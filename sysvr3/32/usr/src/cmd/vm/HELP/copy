   The COPY command allows you to duplicate a selected object  keeping
   one  copy  in  its  original location and moving the other to a new
   location.  In the command syntax, the "object_name" is  the  object
   to  be  copied  and  the  "folder_name"  is the folder in which the
   copy is to be placed. FACE will prompt you for any
   information you do not give.


     1.  To COPY an object use one of the following  options.   If  an
         object is not specified the current object is assumed.

            - Function Key - Press CHG-KEYS then press COPY

            - Command menu - Select COPY + RETURN

            - COMMAND LINE - Type copy [object_name]
                               [to folder_name] + RETURN

     2.  The following message and prompt will appear if you  did  not
         specify a destination folder with the COPY command.

            Open or move to the destination folder and press SELECT.

         SELECT is the label on Function Key F8. Navigate to the
         destination  folder,  opening  it if it is not currently open
         and press SELECT.  If you would like to copy  the  object  to
         the  currently  active folder simply press SELECT.  To cancel
         the COPY command, press the CANCEL Screen Labeled Key.

     3.  If a file with the same name already exists in the destination
         folder, you will be prompted for a new name for the copy.

   To COPY an entire folder to another folder, specify the folder name
   as the object to be copied.
