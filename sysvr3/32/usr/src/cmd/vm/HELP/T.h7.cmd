   The Command Menu is a multi-column menu of the FACE commands.
   It  serves  as  a command reference list and a place from which you
   can issue commands.  To issue a command from the Command Menu:

     1.  Press the Function Key labeled CMD-MENU  or enter the command
         on  the Command  Line. The  Command  menu will appear and the
         Function  Key  labels will  change  to: CANCEL (F1), and HELP
         (F6). Navigate in the Command menu as you would in any  other
         FACE  menu  to select the command you would like to use.

     2.  If you would like to issue a command from the Command menu to
         perform an action  on the current object or current frame, or
         if you would like to issue a command that needs no arguments,
         simply  move the cursor to the command name and press RETURN.
         The  command  selected will  automatically be  issued and the
         Command menu closed.

     3.  If you would like to issue a command from the  Command  menu,
         but  you  would  like  to specify your own command arguments,
         move the cursor to the command you would like  to  issue  and
         press   "CTRL"  and  "z"  at  the  same  time.   The  command
         highlighted in the Command menu will appear  on  the  Command
         Line  waiting  for  you  to  add any additional arguments and
         press RETURN to perform the action.

   If you do not wish to issue a command from the Command  menu  press
   CANCEL to close the Command Menu Frame.

   Pressing HELP brings up a help  message  explaining  the  currently
   active command.
