   The MOVE command allows you to move a selected  object  to  another
   folder.   In the  command syntax, "object_name"  is  the  object to
   be moved and the "folder_name" is the folder in which the object is
   to be placed.

     1.  To MOVE an object use one of the following  options.   If  an
         object is not specified the current object is assumed.

            - Function Key - Press CHG-KEYS, and then MOVE

            - Command menu - Select MOVE + RETURN

            - COMMAND LINE - Type move [object_name]
                               [to folder_name] + RETURN

     2.  The following message and prompt will appear if you  did  not
         specify a destination folder with the MOVE command.

            Open or move to the destination folder and press SELECT.

         SELECT is  the  label on Function Key F8.   Navigate  to  the
         destination  folder,  opening  it if it is not currently open
         and press SELECT.  To cancel  the  MOVE  command,  press  the
         CANCEL Function Key.

     3.  If a file with the same name as the one you are moving
         already exists in the destination folder, you will be
         prompted for a new name.

   To MOVE an entire folder to another folder, specify the folder name
   as the object to be moved.
