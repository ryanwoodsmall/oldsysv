   The OFFICE PREFERENCES form allows you to customize some FACE
   features.   The  following list defines the fields included in this
   form.

      - DELETE OBJECTS FROM  MY  WASTEBASKET  AFTER  (#  of  days)  --
        Objects  may  be  maintained  in your Wastebasket from 1 to 30
        days.  Type in your preference.

      - PROMPT BEFORE EMPTYING THE WASTEBASKET  --  If  you  set  this
        option to 'yes', a prompt will appear when you login notifying
        you that objects in the Wastebasket are  ready  for  deletion.
        If you set this option to 'no', the prompt will not appear and
        objects will be deleted on schedule without an opportunity for
        you to retrieve them.

      - DEFAULT EDITOR -- "vi"  is set  up as  the default  editor for
        FACE.  You can  change your  default editor to any other
        editor  or word  processing  package  on  your  system.  Check
        with  your  system   administrator  for information  on  other
        editors and word processors available on your system.

      - ADDITIONAL  FRAMES OPEN  UPON LOGIN --  The  Office  frame  is
        always  open  upon  login.  In  addition, you may select up to
        4  other frames to be opened.  To use this feature,  type  the
        name  of  each  of the  frames you would like opened, one name
        per line.  Examples are:

        services - an Office menu object
        folder1 - pathname relative to your filecabinet
        /usr/john/FILECABINET/folder1 - full pathname

        Function Keys active for this form (in  addition  to PREV-FRM,
        NEXT-FRM, CMD-MENU, and HELP) are:

           - CANCEL -- Cancels  the form without saving  the field new
             values  entered  in  the  form,  closes  the  frame,  and
             returns you to the point in the interface that  you  were
             at prior to accessing the form.

           - CHOICES  --  For  the  field  where  the  cursor resides,
             pressing  CHOICES  either  toggles  between  the possible
             values for the  field,  or  displays  a  pop-up  menu  of
             available  choices.  For fields requiring you to set your
             own values, a definition of  the field  requirement  will
             appear on the message line.

           - SAVE -- Saves all the field values entered in  the  form,
             closes  the  frame,  and returns  you to the point in the
             interface that you were at prior to accessing the form.

           - RESET - resets the field back to the value(s)  in  effect
             at the beginning of the current editing session.
