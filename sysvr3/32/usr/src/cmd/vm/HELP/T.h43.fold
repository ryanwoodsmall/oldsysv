   File folder objects are the containers for your files.  Just as the
   normal office uses filecabinets, folders and files, FACE uses
   the same objects.

   A folder is a named object that contains  one  or  more  files  and
   other  folders.   Folders  can be created, deleted, redescribed, or
   renamed, by using keyboard keys or  commands.   Deleting  a  folder
   will also delete any objects contained within it.

   You can change the way objects in a folder are displayed (order  of
   presentation  and  amount  of  information)  by  using the ORGANIZE
   command for an individual folder, or  by  using  preferences/folder
   options for your entire Filecabinet and Wastebasket.

   By using  preferences/permissions you may control who has access to
   your  files and  folders.  This  allows  you  to determine  who has
   READ,  WRITE,  and  RUN/SEARCH permissions for yourself, your group
   (check with your system administrator), and anyone  with access to
   the system.
