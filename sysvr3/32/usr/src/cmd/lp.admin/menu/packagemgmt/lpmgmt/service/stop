## IDOC:   SCREEN 2.53: STOP PRINT SERVICE
#menu# Stop the print service

##+++ (help _H143)
#help#        You use the "stop" command in the "service" menu to stop the
#help#        LP   Print   Service.    Normally  the  print  services  are
#help#        automatically stopped when you stop the UNIX system, so  you
#help#        generally don't need to use this command.
#help#
#help#                                   NOTICE
#help# You don't have to stop the print services to  change  any  printers,  forms,
#help# filters,  or  to  move  print  requests.   In fact, if you DO stop the print
#help# services you'll be unable to properly affect SOME changes.
