#head#                   FORMS MANAGEMENT MENU

#help#        The "forms" menu gives you several commands:  for adding new
#help#        preprinted  forms  to  the  print service; for changing form
#help#        definitions; for mounting forms on printers;  for  adjusting
#help#        the alerting schedule for unmounted forms; and for examining
#help#        the forms recognized by the print service.
#help#
#help#        Preprinted forms, by the way, include the various  kinds  of
#help#        paper  stock  you  may want to use in your printers.  The LP
#help#        Print Service lets you define enough of the form so that the
#help#        print  service  can  prescreen users' requests, route users'
#help#        print requests to the proper  destination,  caution  against
#help#        using  a form with the wrong printer, and remind you that it
#help#        is time to mount a new form.
