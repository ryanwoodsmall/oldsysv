#menu# Start the print service

##+++ (help _H142)
#help#        You use the "start" command in the "service" menu  to  start
#help#        the  LP  Print  Service after it has been stopped.  Normally
#help#        the print services are automatically started when you  start
#help#        the  UNIX  system,  so  you generally don't need to use this
#help#        command.
