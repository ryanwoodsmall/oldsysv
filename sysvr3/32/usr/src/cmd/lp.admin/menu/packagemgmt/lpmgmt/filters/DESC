#head#                   FILTER MANAGEMENT MENU

#help#        The "filters" menu gives you several commands:   for  adding
#help#        new  filters;  changing  the  description  of  a filter; and
#help#        examining the filters available.
#help#
#help#        Filters, by the way, are used by the  LP  Print  Service  to
#help#        handle   several  aspects  of  preparing  users'  files  for
#help#        printing.  The printing of a subset of pages; the  automatic
#help#        restarting  of  printing  where it left off; the handling of
#help#        special modes like one or two-sided, landscape or  portrait,
#help#        draft   vs  letter-quality;  are  all  handled  by  filters.
#help#        Filters also provide automatic conversion from one  type  of
#help#        file   to   another,  so  that  files  produced  by  various
#help#        application programs can be printed properly.
