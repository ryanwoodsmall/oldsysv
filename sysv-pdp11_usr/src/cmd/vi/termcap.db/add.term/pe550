I have been using the following termcap entry successfully
for several weeks:

pb|bantam|550|perkin elmer 550:\
	:ns:bs:ce=\EI:cl=20\EK:co#80:ho=\EH:li#24:\
	:ll=\EH\EA:nd=\EC:cm=\EX%+ \EY%+ :up=\EA:

How about installing it in /etc/termcap so I can get rid of
my private termcap?

Does the following line from /etc/termcap have any meaning
for either me or you?

# Mail changes to csvax:mark, csvax.mark@berkeley, or ucbvax!mark or lose them!
